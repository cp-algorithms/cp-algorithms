/**
 * @brief Calculates the maximum water that can be trapped between vertical
 * lines on a 2D plane.
 *
 * Given an array of non-negative integers representing vertical lines on a 2D
 * plane, where the width of each line is 1, the function finds two lines that,
 * together with the x-axis, form a container that can hold the most water.
 *
 * The problem can be efficiently solved using a two-pointer approach. We
 * initialize two pointers, 'left' and 'right', at the beginning and end of the
 * array, respectively. The width of the container is determined by the
 * difference between the 'right' and 'left' pointers. To maximize the water
 * trapped, we choose the minimum height between the lines at the 'left' and
 * 'right' positions. We then calculate the water trapped by multiplying the
 * width and height. We move the pointers towards each other, adjusting them
 * based on the shorter line, as moving the pointer with the smaller height has
 * the potential to increase the water volume.
 *
 * @param height Vector representing the heights of vertical lines.
 * @return int Maximum water that can be trapped.
