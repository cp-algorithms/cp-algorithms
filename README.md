The goal of this project is to translate the wonderful resource
[http://e-maxx.ru/algo](http://e-maxx.ru/algo) which provides descriptions of many algorithms
and data structures especially popular in field of competitive programming.
Moreover we want to improve the collected knowledge by extending the articles
and adding new articles to the collection.

Compiled pages are published at [https://cp-algorithms.com/](https://cp-algorithms.com/).

## Changelog

- October 31, 2022: It is now possible to select and copy $\LaTeX$ source code of formulas within the articles.
- June 8, 2022: Tags are enabled. Each article is now marked whether it is translated or original, overall tag info is present in the [tag index](https://cp-algorithms.com/tags.html). For translated articles, clicking on `From: X` tag would lead to the original article.
- June 7, 2022: Date of last commit and author list with contribution percentage is tracked for each page.
- June 5, 2022: Enabled content tabs and sidebar navigation. The navigation is moved to a [separate page](https://cp-algorithms.com/navigation.html) and its structure should be adjusted in [navigation.md](https://github.com/e-maxx-eng/e-maxx-eng/blob/master/src/navigation.md) whenever a new article is created or an old one is moved.
- January 16, 2022: Switched to the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site generator with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, which give the website a more modern look, brings a couple of new features (dark mode, better search, ...), makes the website more stable (in terms of rendering math formulas), and makes it easier to contribute.
