There is a generic connection between periodic continued fractions and quadratic equations.

It follows from the equation that $x$ is a root of the second degree equation:</p> $$q_k x^2 + (q_{k-1}-p_k)x - p_{k-1} = 0.$$ <p>Similar reasoning stands for continued fractions that are eventually periodic, that is $x = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_k, y]$ for $y=[b_0; b_1, \\dots, b_k, y]$. Indeed, from first equation we derive that $x = L_0(y)$ and from second equation that $y = L_1(y)$, where $L_0$ and $L_1$ are linear fractional transformations. Therefore,</p> $$x = (L_0 \\circ L_1)(y) = (L_0 \\circ L_1 \\circ L_0^{-1})(x).$$ <p>One can further prove (and it was first done by Lagrange) that for arbitrary quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ with integer coefficients, its solution $x$ is an eventually periodic continued fraction.</p> <p>Quadratic irrationality</p> <p>Find the continued fraction of $\\alpha = \\frac{x+y\\sqrt{n}}{z}$ where $x, y, z, n \\in \\mathbb Z$ and $n &gt; 0$ is not a perfect square.</p> Solution <p>For the $k$-th complete quotient $s_k$ of the number it generally holds that</p> $$\\alpha = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}, s_k] = \\frac{s_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}}{s_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}}.$$ <p>Therefore, </p> $$s_k = -\\frac{\\alpha q_{k-1} - p_{k-1}}{\\alpha q_k - p_k} = -\\frac{q_{k-1} y \\sqrt n + (x q_{k-1} - z p_{k-1})}{q_k y \\sqrt n + (xq_k-zp_k)}.$$ <p>Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $(xq_k - zp_k) - q_k y \\sqrt n$, we'll get rid of $\\sqrt n$ in the denominator, thus the complete quotients are of form</p> $$s_k = \\frac{x_k + y_k \\sqrt n}{z_k}.$$ <p>Let's find $s_{k+1}$, assuming that $s_k$ is known.</p> <p>First of all, $a_k = \\lfloor s_k \\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x_k + y_k \\lfloor \\sqrt n \\rfloor}{z_k} \\right\\rfloor$.

We still want to multiply two polynomials in $O(n \\log n)$ time, but this time we want to compute the coefficients modulo some prime number $p$. Of course for this task we can use the normal DFT and apply the modulo operator to the result. However, doing so might lead to rounding errors, especially when dealing with large numbers. The number theoretic transform (NTT) has the advantage, that it only works with integer, and therefore the result are guaranteed to be correct.</p> <p>The discrete Fourier transform is based on complex numbers, and the $n$-th roots of unity.

A $n$-th root of unity under a primitive field is such a number $w_n$ that satisfies:</p> $$\\begin{align} (w_n)^n &amp;= 1 \\pmod{p}, \\\\ (w_n)^k &amp;\\ne 1 \\pmod{p}, \\quad 1 \\le k &lt; n. \\end{align}$$ <p>The other $n-1$ roots can be obtained as powers of the root $w_n$.</p> <p>To apply it in the fast Fourier transform algorithm, we need a root to exist for some $n$, which is a power of $2$, and also for all smaller powers.

It's a memory-optimization specialization of <code>vector&lt;T&gt;</code>, that only consumes $\\frac{N}{8}$ bytes of memory.</p> <p>Modern processors architectures work much more efficiently with bytes than with bits as they usually cannot access bits directly.

We can work on blocks by turns, i.e. for every block $k$ we will go through all the prime numbers (from $1$ to $\\sqrt n$) and perform sieving using them. It is worth noting, that we have to modify the strategy a little bit when handling the first numbers: first, all the prime numbers from $[1; \\sqrt n]$  shouldn't remove themselves; and second, the numbers $0$ and $1$ should be marked as non-prime numbers. While working on the last block it should not be forgotten that the last needed number $n$ is not necessarily located at the end of the block.</p> <p>As discussed previously, the typical implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is limited by the speed how fast you can load data into the CPU caches. By splitting the range of potential prime numbers $[1; n]$ into smaller blocks, we never have to keep multiple blocks in memory at the same time, and all operations are much more cache-friendlier.

It is obvious that we can change the order of summation. We let the sum iterate over all elements $f$ and sum over the values $J(f)$ - the number of permutations for which $f$ is a fixed point.</p> $$|\\text{Classes}| \\cdot |G| = \\sum_{f} J(f)$$ <p>To prove this formula we will compose a table with columns labeled with all functions $f_i$ and rows labeled with all permutations $\\pi_j$. And we fill the cells with $f_i \\pi_j$. If we look at the columns in this table as sets, then some of them will coincide, and this means that the corresponding functions $f$ for these columns are also equivalent. Thus the numbers of different (as sets) columns is equal to the number of classes. Incidentally, from the standpoint of group theory, the column labeled with $f_i$ is the orbit of this element. For equivalent elements the orbits coincides, and the number of orbits gives exactly the number of classes.</p> <p>Thus the columns of the table decompose into equivalence classes. Let us fix a class, and look at the columns in it. First, note that these columns can only contain elements $f_i$ of the equivalence class (otherwise some permutation $\\pi_j$ moved one of the functions into a different equivalence class, which is impossible since we only look at invariant permutations). Secondly each element $f_i$ will occur the same number of times in each column (this also follows from the fact that the columns correspond to equivalent elements). From this we can conclude, that all the columns within the same equivalence class coincide with each other as multisets.</p> <p>Now fix an arbitrary element $f$. On the one hand, it occurs in its column exactly $J(f)$ times (by definition). On the other hand, all columns within the same equivalence class are the same as multisets.

(Note that we are using zero-based indexing.) A Fenwick tree is just an array, $T[0 \\dots N-1]$, where each element is equal to the sum of elements of $A$ in some range, $[g(i), i]$:</p> $$T_i = \\sum_{j = g(i)}^{i}{A_j}$$ <p>where $g$ is some function that satisfies $0 \\le g(i) \\le i$. We will define $g$ in the next few paragraphs.</p> <p>The data structure is called a tree because there is a nice representation of it in the form of a tree, although we don't need to model an actual tree with nodes and edges. We only need to maintain the array $T$ to handle all queries.</p> <p>Note: The Fenwick tree presented here uses zero-based indexing. Many people use a version of the Fenwick tree that uses one-based indexing. As such, you will also find an alternative implementation which uses one-based indexing in the implementation section. Both versions are equivalent in terms of time and memory complexity.</p> <p>Now we can write some pseudo-code for the two operations mentioned above.

Therefore, it updates all elements in $T$ that correspond to ranges in which $A_i$ lies.</li> </ol> <p>The complexity of both <code>sum</code> and <code>increase</code> depend on the function $g$. There are many ways to choose the function $g$ such that $0 \\le g(i) \\le i$ for all $i$. For instance, the function $g(i) = i$ works, which yields $T = A$ (in which case, the summation queries are slow). We could also take the function $g(i) = 0$. This would correspond to prefix sum arrays (in which case, finding the sum of the range $[0, i]$ will only take constant time; however, updates are slow).

As an input we receive two integers $l$ and $r$, and we have to compute the sum of the segment $a[l \\dots r]$ in $O(\\log n)$ time. </p> <p>To do this, we will traverse the Segment Tree and use the precomputed sums of the segments. Let's assume that we are currently at the vertex that covers the segment $a[tl \\dots tr]$. There are three possible cases. </p> <p>The easiest case is when the segment $a[l \\dots r]$ is equal to the corresponding segment of the current vertex (i.e. $a[l \\dots r] = a[tl \\dots tr]$), then we are finished and can return the precomputed sum that is stored in the vertex.</p> <p>Alternatively the segment of the query can fall completely into the domain of either the left or the right child. Recall that the left child covers the segment $a[tl \\dots tm]$ and the right vertex covers the segment $a[tm + 1 \\dots tr]$ with $tm = (tl + tr) / 2$.  In this case we can simply go to the child vertex, which corresponding segment covers the query segment, and execute the algorithm described here with that vertex. </p> <p>And then there is the last case, the query segment intersects with both children.  In this case we have no other option as to make two recursive calls, one for each child. First we go to the left child, compute a partial answer for this vertex (i.e. the sum of values of the intersection between the segment of the query and the segment of the left child), then go to the right child, compute the partial answer using that vertex, and then combine the answers by adding them.  In other words, since the left child represents the segment $a[tl \\dots tm]$ and the right child the segment $a[tm+1 \\dots tr]$, we compute the sum query $a[l \\dots tm]$ using the left child, and the sum query $a[tm+1 \\dots r]$ using the right child. </p> <p>So processing a sum query is a function that recursively calls itself once with either the left or the right child (without changing the query boundaries), or twice, once for the left and once for the right child (by splitting the query into two subqueries).  And the recursion ends, whenever the boundaries of the current query segment coincides with the boundaries of the segment of the current vertex.  In that case the answer will be the precomputed value of the sum of this segment, which is stored in the tree.</p> <p>In other words, the calculation of the query is a traversal of the tree, which spreads through all necessary branches of the tree, and uses the precomputed sum values of the segments in the tree. </p> <p>Obviously we will start the traversal from the root vertex of the Segment Tree.</p> <p>The procedure is illustrated in the following image. Again the array $a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]$ is used, and here we want to compute the sum $\\sum_{i=2}^4 a[i]$. The colored vertices will be visited, and we will use the precomputed values of the green vertices. This gives us the result $-2 + 1 = -1$.</p> <p></p> <p>Why is the complexity of this algorithm $O(\\log n)$? To show this complexity we look at each level of the tree.  It turns out, that for each level we only visit not more than four vertices.  And since the height of the tree is $O(\\log n)$, we receive the desired running time. </p> <p>We can show that this proposition (at most four vertices each level) is true by induction. At the first level, we only visit one vertex, the root vertex, so here we visit less than four vertices.  Now let's look at an arbitrary level. By induction hypothesis, we visit at most four vertices.  If we only visit at most two vertices, the next level has at most four vertices. That is trivial, because each vertex can only cause at most two recursive calls.  So let's assume that we visit three or four vertices in the current level.  From those vertices, we will analyze the vertices in the middle more carefully.  Since the sum query asks for the sum of a continuous subarray, we know that segments corresponding to the visited vertices in the middle will be completely covered by the segment of the sum query.  Therefore these vertices will not make any recursive calls.  So only the most left, and the most right vertex will have the potential to make recursive calls.  And those will only create at most four recursive calls, so also the next level will satisfy the assertion. We can say that one branch approaches the left boundary of the query, and the second branch approaches the right one. </p> <p>Therefore we visit at most $4 \\log n$ vertices in total, and that is equal to a running time of $O(\\log n)$. </p> <p>In conclusion the query works by dividing the input segment into several sub-segments for which all the sums are already precomputed and stored in the tree.

Each level of a Segment Tree forms a partition of the array.  Therefore an element $a[i]$ only contributes to one segment from each level.

We will use a simple trick to make this a lot more efficient by using an implicit data structure: Only storing the sums in an array. (A similar method is used for binary heaps). The sum of the root vertex at index 1, the sums of its two child vertices at indices 2 and 3, the sums of the children of those two vertices at indices 4 to 7, and so on.  With 1-indexing, conveniently the left child of a vertex at index $i$ is stored at index $2i$, and the right one at index $2i + 1$.

We will improve the time complexity using the technique \"fractional cascading\".</p> <p>Fractional cascading is a simple technique that allows you to improve the running time of multiple binary searches, which are conducted at the same time.  Our previous approach to the search query was, that we divide the task into several subtasks, each of which is solved with a binary search.  Fractional cascading allows you to replace all of these binary searches with a single one.</p> <p>The simplest and most obvious example of fractional cascading is the following problem: there are $k$ sorted lists of numbers, and we must find in each list the first number greater than or equal to the given number.</p> <p>Instead of performing a binary search for each list, we could merge all lists into one big sorted list. Additionally for each element $y$ we store a list of results of searching for $y$ in each of the $k$ lists. Therefore if we want to find the smallest number greater than or equal to $x$, we just need to perform one single binary search, and from the list of indices we can determine the smallest number in each list. This approach however requires $O(n \\cdot k)$ ($n$ is the length of the combined lists), which can be quite inefficient. </p> <p>Fractional cascading reduces this memory complexity to $O(n)$ memory, by creating from the $k$ input lists $k$ new lists, in which each list contains the corresponding list and additionally also every second element of the following new list. Using this structure it is only necessary to store two indices, the index of the element in the original list, and the index of the element in the following new list. So this approach only uses $O(n)$ memory, and still can answer the queries using a single binary search. </p> <p>But for our application we do not need the full power of fractional cascading. In our Segment Tree a vertex will contain the sorted list of all elements that occur in either the left or the right subtrees (like in the Merge Sort Tree).  Additionally to this sorted list, we store two positions for each element. For an element $y$ we store the smallest index $i$, such that the $i$th element in the sorted list of the left child is greater or equal to $y$. And we store the smallest index $j$, such that the $j$th element in the sorted list of the right child is greater or equal to $y$. These values can be computed in parallel to the merging step when we build the tree.</p> <p>How does this speed up the queries?</p> <p>Remember, in the normal solution we did a binary search in every node. But with this modification, we can avoid all except one.</p> <p>To answer a query, we simply do a binary search in the root node. This gives us the smallest element $y \\ge x$ in the complete array, but it also gives us two positions. The index of the smallest element greater or equal $x$ in the left subtree, and the index of the smallest element $y$ in the right subtree. Notice that $\\ge y$ is the same as $\\ge x$, since our array doesn't contain any elements between $x$ and $y$. In the normal Merge Sort Tree solution we would compute these indices via binary search, but with the help of the precomputed values we can just look them up in $O(1)$. And we can repeat that until we visited all nodes that cover our query interval.</p> <p>To summarize, as usual we touch $O(\\log n)$ nodes during a query. In the root node we do a binary search, and in all other nodes we only do constant work. This means the complexity for answering a query is $O(\\log n)$.</p> <p>But notice, that this uses three times more memory than a normal Merge Sort Tree, which already uses a lot of memory ($O(n \\log n)$).</p> <p>It is straightforward to apply this technique to a problem, that doesn't require any modification queries. The two positions are just integers and can easily be computed by counting when merging the two sorted sequences.</p> <p>It it still possible to also allow modification queries, but that complicates the entire code.

This might sound like a lot worse than the methods in the previous section, since this is a slightly worse complexity than we had earlier and cannot update values between two queries. But in a lot of situations this method has advantages. During a normal sqrt decomposition, we have to precompute the answers for each block, and merge them during answering queries. In some problems this merging step can be quite problematic. E.g. when each queries asks to find the mode of its range (the number that appears the most often). For this each block would have to store the count of each number in it in some sort of data structure, and we cannot longer perform the merge step fast enough any more.

In fact, implicit treap can be considered as an array with the following procedures implemented (all in $O (\\log N)$ in the online mode):</p> <ul> <li>Inserting an element in the array in any location</li> <li>Removal of an arbitrary element</li> <li>Finding sum, minimum / maximum element etc. on an arbitrary interval</li> <li>Addition, painting on an arbitrary interval</li> <li>Reversing elements on an arbitrary interval</li> </ul> <p>The idea is that the keys should be null-based indices of the elements in the array. But we will not store these values explicitly (otherwise, for example, inserting an element would cause changes of the key in $O (N)$ nodes of the tree).</p> <p>Note that the key of a node is the number of nodes less than it (such nodes can be present not only in its left subtree but also in left subtrees of its ancestors).  More specifically, the implicit key for some node T is the number of vertices $cnt (T \\rightarrow L)$ in the left subtree of this node plus similar values $cnt (P \\rightarrow L) + 1$ for each ancestor P of the node T, if T is in the right subtree of P.</p> <p>Now it's clear how to calculate the implicit key of current node quickly. Since in all operations we arrive to any node by descending in the tree, we can just accumulate this sum and pass it to the function. If we go to the left subtree, the accumulated sum does not change, if we go to the right subtree it increases by $cnt (T \\rightarrow L) +1$.</p> <p>Here are the new implementations of Split and Merge:</p> <pre><code>void merge (pitem &amp; t, pitem l, pitem r) {\n    if (!l || !r)\n        t = l ? l : r;\n    else if (l-&gt;prior &gt; r-&gt;prior)\n        merge (l-&gt;r, l-&gt;r, r),  t = l;\n    else\n        merge (r-&gt;l, l, r-&gt;l),  t = r;\n    upd_cnt (t);\n}\n\nvoid split (pitem t, pitem &amp; l, pitem &amp; r, int key, int add = 0) {\n    if (!t)\n        return void( l = r = 0 );\n    int cur_key = add + cnt(t-&gt;l); //implicit key\n    if (key &lt;= cur_key)\n        split (t-&gt;l, l, t-&gt;l, key, add),  r = t;\n    else\n        split (t-&gt;r, t-&gt;r, r, key, add + 1 + cnt(t-&gt;l)),  l = t;\n    upd_cnt (t);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the implementation above, after the call of $split(T, T_1, T_2, k)$, the tree $T_1$ will consist of first $k$ elements of $T$ (that is, of elements having their implicit key less than $k$) and $T_2$ will consist of all the rest.</p> <p>Now let's consider the implementation of various operations on implicit treaps:</p> <ul> <li>Insert element.   Suppose we need to insert an element at position $pos$. We divide the treap into two parts, which correspond to arrays $[0..pos-1]$ and $[pos..sz]$; to do this we call $split(T, T_1, T_2, pos)$. Then we can combine tree $T_1$ with the new vertex by calling $merge(T_1, T_1, \\text{new item})$ (it is easy to see that all preconditions are met). Finally, we combine trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ back into $T$ by calling $merge(T, T_1, T_2)$.</li> <li>Delete element.  This operation is even easier: find the element to be deleted $T$, perform merge of its children $L$ and $R$, and replace the element $T$ with the result of merge. In fact, element deletion in the implicit treap is exactly the same as in the regular treap.</li> <li>Find sum / minimum, etc. on the interval.  First, create an additional field $F$ in the <code>item</code> structure to store the value of the target function for this node's subtree. This field is easy to maintain similarly to maintaining sizes of subtrees: create a function which calculates this value for a node based on values for its children and add calls of this function in the end of all functions which modify the tree.  Second, we need to know how to process a query for an arbitrary interval $[A; B]$.  To get a part of tree which corresponds to the interval $[A; B]$, we need to call $split(T, T_2, T_3, B+1)$, and then $split(T_2, T_1, T_2, A)$: after this $T_2$ will consist of all the elements in the interval $[A; B]$, and only of them. Therefore, the response to the query will be stored in the field $F$ of the root of $T_2$. After the query is answered, the tree has to be restored by calling $merge(T, T_1, T_2)$ and $merge(T, T, T_3)$.</li> <li>Addition / painting on the interval.  We act similarly to the previous paragraph, but instead of the field F we will store a field <code>add</code> which will contain the added value for the subtree (or the value to which the subtree is painted). Before performing any operation we have to \"push\" this value correctly - i.e. change $T \\rightarrow L \\rightarrow add$ and $T \\rightarrow R \\rightarrow add$, and to clean up <code>add</code> in the parent node. This way after any changes to the tree the information will not be lost.</li> <li>Reverse on the interval.  This is again similar to the previous operation: we have to add boolean flag <code>rev</code> and set it to true when the subtree of the current node has to be reversed. \"Pushing\" this value is a bit complicated - we swap children of this node and set this flag to true for them.</li> </ul> <p>Here is an example implementation of the implicit treap with reverse on the interval. For each node we store field called <code>value</code> which is the actual value of the array element at current position. We also provide implementation of the function <code>output()</code>, which outputs an array that corresponds to the current state of the implicit treap.</p> <pre><code>typedef struct item * pitem;\nstruct item {\n    int prior, value, cnt;\n    bool rev;\n    pitem l, r;\n};\n\nint cnt (pitem it) {\n    return it ? it-&gt;cnt : 0;\n}\n\nvoid upd_cnt (pitem it) {\n    if (it)\n        it-&gt;cnt = cnt(it-&gt;l) + cnt(it-&gt;r) + 1;\n}\n\nvoid push (pitem it) {\n    if (it &amp;&amp; it-&gt;rev) {\n        it-&gt;rev = false;\n        swap (it-&gt;l, it-&gt;r);\n        if (it-&gt;l)  it-&gt;l-&gt;rev ^= true;\n        if (it-&gt;r)  it-&gt;r-&gt;rev ^= true;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid merge (pitem &amp; t, pitem l, pitem r) {\n    push (l);\n    push (r);\n    if (!l || !r)\n        t = l ? l : r;\n    else if (l-&gt;prior &gt; r-&gt;prior)\n        merge (l-&gt;r, l-&gt;r, r),  t = l;\n    else\n        merge (r-&gt;l, l, r-&gt;l),  t = r;\n    upd_cnt (t);\n}\n\nvoid split (pitem t, pitem &amp; l, pitem &amp; r, int key, int add = 0) {\n    if (!t)\n        return void( l = r = 0 );\n    push (t);\n    int cur_key = add + cnt(t-&gt;l);\n    if (key &lt;= cur_key)\n        split (t-&gt;l, l, t-&gt;l, key, add),  r = t;\n    else\n        split (t-&gt;r, t-&gt;r, r, key, add + 1 + cnt(t-&gt;l)),  l = t;\n    upd_cnt (t);\n}\n\nvoid reverse (pitem t, int l, int r) {\n    pitem t1, t2, t3;\n    split (t, t1, t2, l);\n    split (t2, t2, t3, r-l+1);\n    t2-&gt;rev ^= true;\n    merge (t, t1, t2);\n    merge (t, t, t3);\n}\n\nvoid output (pitem t) {\n    if (!t)  return;\n    push (t);\n    output (t-&gt;l);\n    printf (\"%d \", t-&gt;value);\n    output (t-&gt;r);\n}\n</code></pre>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"data_structures/treap.html#literature","title":"Literature","text":"<ul> <li>Blelloch, Reid-Miller \"Fast Set Operations Using Treaps\"</li> </ul>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"data_structures/treap.html#practice-problems","title":"Practice Problems","text":"<ul> <li>SPOJ - Ada and Aphids</li> <li>SPOJ - Ada and Harvest</li> <li>Codeforces - Radio Stations</li> <li>SPOJ - Ghost Town</li> <li>SPOJ - Arrangement Validity</li> <li>SPOJ - All in One</li> <li>Codeforces - Dog Show</li> <li>Codeforces - Yet Another Array Queries Problem</li> <li>SPOJ - Mean of Array</li> <li>SPOJ - TWIST</li> <li>SPOJ - KOILINE</li> <li>CodeChef - The Prestige</li> <li>Codeforces - T-Shirts</li> <li>Codeforces - Wizards and Roads</li> <li>Codeforces - Yaroslav and Points</li> </ul>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"dynamic_programming/divide-and-conquer-dp.html","title":"Divide and Conquer DP","text":"<p>Divide and Conquer is a dynamic programming optimization.</p>","tags":["Original"]},{"location":"dynamic_programming/divide-and-conquer-dp.html#preconditions","title":"Preconditions","text":"<p>Some dynamic programming problems have a recurrence of this form: </p> $$ dp(i, j) = \\min_{0 \\leq k \\leq j} \\\\{ dp(i - 1, k - 1) + C(k, j) \\\\} $$ <p>where $C(k, j)$ is a cost function and $dp(i, j) = 0$ when $j \\lt 0$. </p> <p>Say $0 \\leq i \\lt m$ and $0 \\leq j \\lt n$, and evaluating $C$ takes $O(1)$ time.

That is, in order to calculate $f(n)$ we only need to know $f(n-1),f(n-2), \\dots ,f(0)$. Therefore, instead of recalculating these subproblems, we solve them once and then save the result in a lookup table.  Subsequent calls will use this lookup table and immediately return a result, thus eliminating exponential work! </p> <p>Each recursive call will check against a lookup table to see if the value has been calculated.

Therefore,  we will not miss the answer if we act as follows: for every cell <code>j</code> in row <code>i</code> (the bottom row of a potential zero submatrix) we will have <code>d[i][j]</code> as the top row of the current zero submatrix. It now remains to determine the optimal left and right boundaries of the zero submatrix, i.e. maximally push this submatrix to the left and right of the <code>j</code>-th column. </p> <p>What does it mean to push the maximum to the left? It means to find an index <code>k1</code> for which <code>d[i][k1] &gt; d[i][j]</code>, and at the same time <code>k1</code> - the closest one to the left of the index <code>j</code>.

We can do that in $O(1)$ on average.</p> <p>To achieve such complexity, you can use the stack as follows. Let's first learn how to search for an index <code>k1</code>, and save its value for each index <code>j</code> within the current row <code>i</code> in matrix <code>d1[i][j]</code>. To do this, we will look through all the columns <code>j</code> from left to right, and we will store in the stack only those columns that have <code>d[][]</code> strictly greater than <code>d[i][j]</code>. It is clear that when moving from a column <code>j</code> to the next column, it is necessary to update the content of the stack. When there is an inappropriate element at the top of the stack (i.e. <code>d[][] &lt;= d[i][j]</code>) pop it. It is easy to understand that it is enough to remove from the stack only from its top, and from none of its other places (because the stack will contain an increasing <code>d</code> sequence of columns).</p> <p>The value <code>d1[i][j]</code> for each <code>j</code> will be equal to the value lying at that moment on top of the stack.</p> <p>The dynamics <code>d2[i][j]</code> for finding the indices <code>k2</code> is considered similar, only you need to view the columns from right to left.</p> <p>It is clear that since there are exactly <code>m</code> pieces added to the stack on each line, there could not be more deletions either, the sum of complexities will be linear, so the final complexity of the algorithm is $O(nm)$.</p> <p>It should also be noted that this algorithm consumes $O(m)$ memory (not counting the input data - the matrix <code>a[][]</code>).</p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"dynamic_programming/zero_matrix.html#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"<pre><code>int zero_matrix(vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; a) {\n    int n = a.size();\n    int m = a[0].size();\n\n    int ans = 0;\n    vector&lt;int&gt; d(m, -1), d1(m), d2(m);\n    stack&lt;int&gt; st;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; m; ++j) {\n            if (a[i][j] == 1)\n                d[j] = i;\n        }\n\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; m; ++j) {\n            while (!st.empty() &amp;&amp; d[st.top()] &lt;= d[j])\n                st.pop();\n            d1[j] = st.empty() ? -1 : st.top();\n            st.push(j);\n        }\n        while (!st.empty())\n            st.pop();\n\n        for (int j = m - 1; j &gt;= 0; --j) {\n            while (!st.empty() &amp;&amp; d[st.top()] &lt;= d[j])\n                st.pop();\n            d2[j] = st.empty() ? m : st.top();\n            st.push(j);\n        }\n        while (!st.empty())\n            st.pop();\n\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; m; ++j)\n            ans = max(ans, (i - d[j]) * (d2[j] - d1[j] - 1));\n    }\n    return ans;\n}\n</code></pre>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"game_theory/games_on_graphs.html","title":"Games on arbitrary graphs","text":"<p>Let a game be played by two players on an arbitrary graph $G$.

However they also can skip a turn if they want to. The first move is made by the policeman.</p> <p>We will now construct the graph. For this we must formalize the rules of the game. The current state of the game is determined by the coordinates of the police offices $P$, the coordinates of the thief $T$, and also by whose turn it is, let's call this variable $P_{\\text{turn}}$ (which is true when it is the policeman's turn).

Bouton looks like this:</p> <p>Theorem. The current player has a winning strategy if and only if the xor-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero.

The key to the proof is the presence of a symmetric strategy for the opponent. We show that a once in a position with the xor-sum equal to zero, the player won't be able to make it non-zero in the long term \u2014 if they transition to a position with a non-zero xor-sum, the opponent will always have a move returning the xor-sum back to zero.</p> <p>We will prove the theorem by mathematical induction.</p> <p>For an empty Nim (where all the piles are empty i.e. the multiset is empty) the xor-sum is zero and the theorem is true.</p> <p>Now suppose we are in a non-empty state. Using the assumption of induction (and the acyclicity of the game) we assume that the theorem is proven for all states reachable from the current one.</p> <p>Then the proof splits into two parts: if for the current position the xor-sum $s = 0$, we have to prove that this state is losing, i.e. all reachable states have xor-sum $t \\neq 0$. If $s \\neq 0$, we have to prove that there is a move leading to a state with $t = 0$.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Let $s = 0$ and let's consider any move.     This move reduces the size of a pile $x$ to a size $y$.     Using elementary properties of $\\oplus$, we have</p> $$ t = s \\oplus x \\oplus y = 0 \\oplus x \\oplus y = x \\oplus y $$ <p>Since $y &lt; x$, $y \\oplus x$ can't be zero, so $t \\neq 0$. That means any reachable state is a winning one (by the assumption of induction), so we are in a losing position.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let $s \\neq 0$.     Consider the binary representation of the number $s$.     Let $d$ be the index of its leading (biggest value) non-zero bit.     Our move will be on a pile whose size's bit number $d$ is set (it must exist, otherwise the bit wouldn't be set in $s$).     We will reduce its size $x$ to $y = x \\oplus s$.     All bits at positions greater than $d$ in $x$ and $y$ match and bit $d$ is set in $x$ but not set in $y$.     Therefore, $y &lt; x$, which is all we need for a move to be legal.     Now we have:</p> $$ t = s \\oplus x \\oplus y = s \\oplus x \\oplus (s \\oplus x) = 0 $$ <p>This means we found a reachable losing state (by the assumption of induction) and the current state is winning.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Corollary.

The idea is to first play the mis\u00e8re game like the standard game, but change the strategy at the end of the game.

Initially your fuel tank is empty and you spend one liter of gasoline per kilometer. Cities are located on the same line in ascending order with $k^{th}$ city having coordinate $x_k$. Also you have to pay $toll_k$ to enter $k^{th}$ city. Your task is to make the trip with minimum possible cost.

There are two main approaches one can use here.</p>","tags":["Original"]},{"location":"geometry/convex_hull_trick.html#convex-hull-trick","title":"Convex hull trick","text":"<p>The idea of this approach is to maintain a lower convex hull of linear functions. Actually it would be a bit more convenient to consider them not as linear functions, but as points $(k;b)$ on the plane such that we will have to find the point which has the least dot product with a given point $(x;1)$, that is, for this point $kx+b$ is minimized which is the same as initial problem. Such minimum will necessarily be on lower convex envelope of these points as can be seen below:</p> <p> </p> <p>One has to keep points on the convex hull and normal vectors of the hull's edges. When you have a $(x;1)$ query you'll have to find the normal vector closest to it in terms of angles between them, then the optimum linear function will correspond to one of its endpoints. To see that, one should note that points having a constant dot product with $(x;1)$ lie on a line which is orthogonal to $(x;1)$, so the optimum linear function will be the one in which tangent to convex hull which is collinear with normal to $(x;1)$ touches the hull. This point is the one such that normals of edges lying to the left and to the right of it are headed in different sides of $(x;1)$.</p> <p>This approach is useful when queries of adding linear functions are monotone in terms of $k$ or if we work offline, i.e. we may firstly add all linear functions and answer queries afterwards. So we cannot solve the cities/gasoline problems using this way. That would require handling online queries. When it comes to deal with online queries however, things will go tough and one will have to use some kind of set data structure to implement a proper convex hull. Online approach will however not be considered in this article due to its hardness and because second approach (which is Li Chao tree) allows to solve the problem way more simply. Worth mentioning that one can still use this approach online without complications by square-root-decomposition. That is, rebuild convex hull from scratch each $\\sqrt n$ new lines. </p> <p>To implement this approach one should begin with some geometric utility functions, here we suggest to use the C++ complex number type.</p> <pre><code>typedef int ftype;\ntypedef complex&lt;ftype&gt; point;\n#define x real\n#define y imag\n\nftype dot(point a, point b) {\n    return (conj(a) * b).x();\n}\n\nftype cross(point a, point b) {\n    return (conj(a) * b).y();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here we will assume that when linear functions are added, their $k$ only increases and we want to find minimum values. We will keep points in vector $hull$ and normal vectors in vector $vecs$. When we add a new point, we have to look at the angle formed between last edge in convex hull and vector from last point in convex hull to new point. This angle has to be directed counter-clockwise, that is the dot product of the last normal vector in the hull (directed inside hull) and the vector from the last point to the new one has to be non-negative. As long as this isn't true, we should erase the last point in the convex hull alongside with the corresponding edge.</p> <p><pre><code>vector&lt;point&gt; hull, vecs;\n\nvoid add_line(ftype k, ftype b) {\n    point nw = {k, b};\n    while(!vecs.empty() &amp;&amp; dot(vecs.back(), nw - hull.back()) &lt; 0) {\n        hull.pop_back();\n        vecs.pop_back();\n    }\n    if(!hull.empty()) {\n        vecs.push_back(1i * (nw - hull.back()));\n    }\n    hull.push_back(nw);\n}\n</code></pre> Now to get the minimum value in some point we will find the first normal vector in the convex hull that is directed counter-clockwise from $(x;1)$. The left endpoint of such edge will be the answer.

We can efficiently find that out by comparing the values of the functions in points $l$ and $m$. If the dominating function changes, then it is in $[l;m)$ otherwise it is in $[m;r)$. Now for the half of the segment with no intersection we will pick the lower function and write it in the current vertex. You can see that it will always be the one which is lower in point $m$. After that we recursively go to the other half of the segment with the function which was the upper one.

Let's solve the problem for some segment $(l, r)$ (initially $(l, r) = (0, n - 1)$). If $r - l + 1 = 2$, we will add an edge $(p[l], p[r])$ and return. If $r - l + 1 = 3$, we will firstly add the edges $(p[l], p[l + 1])$ and $(p[l + 1], p[r])$. We must also connect them using <code>splice(a-&gt;Rev, b)</code>. Now we must close the triangle.

Note that our points are sorted, so while merging we will add edges from L to R (so-called cross edges) and remove some edges from L to L and from R to R. What is the structure of the cross edges? All these edges must cross a line parallel to the y-axis and placed at the splitting x value. This establishes a linear ordering of the cross edges, so we can talk about successive cross edges, the bottom-most cross edge, etc. The algorithm will add the cross edges in ascending order. Note that any two adjacent cross edges will have a common endpoint, and the third side of the triangle they define goes from L to L or from R to R. Let's call the current cross edge the base. The successor of the base will either go from the left endpoint of the base to one of the R-neighbors of the right endpoint or vice versa. Consider the circumcircle of base and the previous cross edge. Suppose this circle is transformed into other circles having base as a chord but lying further into the Oy direction. Our circle will go up for a while, but unless base is an upper tangent of L and R we will encounter a point belonging either to L or to R giving rise to a new triangle without any points in the circumcircle. The new L-R edge of this triangle is the next cross edge added. To do this efficiently, we compute two edges <code>lcand</code> and <code>rcand</code> so that <code>lcand</code> points to the first L point encountered in this process, and <code>rcand</code> points to the first R point. Then we choose the one that would be encountered first.

This method is basically equivalent to cutting a convex polygon by a line $N$ times, and removing the redundant half-planes at every step. To do this, we can represent the convex polygon as a list of line segments, and to cut it with a half-plane we simply find the intersection points of the segments with the half-plane line (there will only be two intersection points if the line properly intersects the polygon), and replace all the line segments in-between with the new segment corresponding to the half-plane.

The approach we'll describe next is based on this same algorithm, but instead of computing two separate intersections for the lower and upper halves of the intersections, we'll construct it all at once in one pass with a deque (double-ended queue).</p> <p>The algorithm itself, as the name may spoil, takes advantage of the fact that the resulting region from the intersection of half-planes is convex, and thus it will consist of some segments of half-planes in order sorted by their angles. This leads to a crucial observation: if we incrementally intersect the half-planes in their order sorted by angle (as they would appear in the final, resulting shape of the intersection) and store them in a double-ended queue, then we will only ever need to remove half-planes from the front and the back of the deque.</p> <p>To better visualize this fact, suppose we're performing the incremental approach described previously on a set of half-planes that is sorted by angle (in this case, we'll assume they're sorted from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$), and suppose that we're about to start some arbitrary $k$'th step. This means we have already constructed the intersection of the first $k-1$ half-planes. Now, because the half-planes are sorted by angle, whatever the $k$'th half-plane is, we can be sure that it will form a convex turn with the $(K-1)$'th half-plane. For that reason, a few things may happen:</p> <ol> <li>Some (possibly none) of the half-planes in the back of the intersection may become redundant. In this case, we need to pop these now-useless half-planes from the back of the deque. </li> <li>Some (possibly none) of the half-planes at the front may become redundant. Analogous to case 1, we just pop them from the front of the deque.</li> <li>The intersection may become empty (after handling cases 1 and/or 2). In this case, we just report the intersection is empty and terminate the algorithm.</li> </ol> <p>We say a half-plane is \"redundant\" if it does not contribute anything to the intersection. Such a half-plane could be removed and the resulting intersection would not change at all.</p> <p>Here's a small example with an illustration:</p> <p>Let $H = \\{ A, B, C, D, E \\}$ be the set of half-planes currently present in the intersection. Additionally, let $P = \\{ p, q, r, s \\}$ be the set of intersection points of adjacent half-planes in H. Now, suppose we wish to intersect it with the half-plane $F$, as seen in the illustration below:</p> <p></p> <p>Notice the half-plane $F$ makes $A$ and $E$ redundant in the intersection. So we remove both $A$ and $E$ from the front and back of the intersection, respectively, and add $F$ at the end. And we finally obtain the new intersection $H = \\{ B, C, D, F\\}$ with $P = \\{ q, r, t, u \\}$.</p> <p></p> <p>With all of this in mind, we have almost everything we need to actually implement the algorithm, but we still need to talk about some special cases. At the beginning of the article we said we would add a bounding box to take care of the cases where the intersection could be unbounded, so the only tricky case we actually need to handle is parallel half-planes. We can have two sub-cases: two half-planes can be parallel with the same direction or with opposite direction. The reason this case needs to be handled separately is because we will need to compute intersection points of half-plane lines to be able to check if a half-plane is redundant or not, and two parallel lines have no intersection point, so we need a special way to deal with them.</p> <p>For the case of parallel half-planes of opposite orientation: Notice that, because we're adding the bounding box to deal with the unbounded case, this also deals with the case where we have two adjacent parallel half-planes with opposite directions after sorting, since there will have to be at least one of the bounding-box half-planes in between these two (remember they are sorted by angle). </p> <ul> <li>However, it is possible that, after removing some half-planes from the back of the deque, two parallel half-planes of opposite direction end up together. This case only happens, specifically, when these two half-planes form an empty intersection, as this last half-plane will cause everything to be removed from the deque. To avoid this problem, we have to manually check for parallel half-planes, and if they have opposite direction, we just instantly stop the algorithm and return an empty intersection.</li> </ul> <p>Thus the only case we actually need to handle is having multiple half-planes with the same angle, and it turns out this case is fairly easy to handle: we only have keep the leftmost half-plane and erase the rest, since they will be completely redundant anyways. To sum up, the full algorithm will roughly look as follows:</p> <ol> <li>We begin by sorting the set of half-planes by angle, which takes $O(N \\log N)$ time.</li> <li>We will iterate over the set of half-planes, and for each one, we will perform the incremental procedure, popping from the front and the back of the double-ended queue as necessary. This will take linear time in total, as every half-plane can only be added or removed once.</li> <li>At the end, the convex polygon resulting from the intersection can be simply obtained by computing the intersection points of adjacent half-planes in the deque at the end of the procedure. This will take linear time as well.

Notice that, for some fixed $r$, a circle with radius $r$ can be inscribed inside $P$ only if there exists some point inside $P$ that has distance greater or equal than $r$ to all the points of the boundary of $P$. This condition can be validated by \"shrinking\" the polygon inwards by a distance of $r$ and checking that the polygon remains non-degenerate (or is a point/segment itself). Such procedure can be simulated by taking the half-planes of the polygon sides in counter-clockwise order, translating each of them by a distance of $r$ in the direction of the region they allow (that is, orthogonal to the direction vector of the half-plane), and checking if the intersection is not empty.</p> <p>Clearly, if we can inscribe a circle of radius $r$, we can also inscribe any other circle of radius smaller than $r$. So we can perform a binary search on the radius $r$ and validate every step using half-plane intersection. Also, note that the half-planes of a convex polygon are already sorted by angle, so the sorting step can be skipped in the algorithm.

This is true because their distance is $d(p,s) = |x_p - x_s| + |y_p - y_s| = (x_p + y_p) - (x_s + y_s)$, because $p$ is in the north-north-east octant. As all the next points will not have a smaller value of $x + y$ because of the sorting step, $p$ is guaranteed to have the smaller distance. We can then remove all such points from the active set, and finally add $p$ to the active set.</p> <p>The next question is how to efficiently find which points $s$ have $p$ in the north-north-east octant. That is, which points $s$ satisfy:</p> <ul> <li>$x_s \\leq x_p$</li> <li>$x_p - y_p &lt; x_s - y_s$</li> </ul> <p>Because no points in the active set are in the $R_1$ region of another, we also have that for two points $q_1$ and $q_2$ in the active set, $x_{q_1} \\neq x_{q_2}$ and their ordering implies $x_{q_1} &lt; x_{q_2} \\implies x_{q_1} - y_{q_1} \\leq x_{q_2} - y_{q_2}$.</p> <p>You can try to visualize this on the images above by thinking of the ordering of $x - y$ as a \"sweep-line\" that goes from the north-west to the south-east, so perpendicular to the one that is drawn.</p> <p>This means that if we keep the active set ordered by $x$ the candidates $s$ are consecutively placed. We can then find the largest $x_s \\leq x_p$ and process the points in decreasing order of $x$ until the second condition $x_p - y_p &lt; x_s - y_s$ breaks (we can actually allow that $x_p - y_p = x_s - y_s$ and that deals with the case of points with equal coordinates). Notice that because we remove from the set right after processing, this will have an amortized complexity of $O(n \\log(n))$.     Now that we have the nearest point in the north-east direction, we rotate the points and repeat. It is possible to show that actually we also find this way the nearest point in the south-west direction, so we can repeat only 4 times, instead of 8.</p> <p>In summary we:</p> <ul> <li>Sort the points by $x + y$ in non-decreasing order;</li> <li>For every point, we iterate over the active set starting with the point with the largest $x$ such that $x \\leq x_p$, and we break the loop if  $x_p - y_p \\geq x_s - y_s$.

The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:</p> $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ <p>The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \\log n).$</p> <p>So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:</p> $$p_i &lt; p_j \\Longleftrightarrow (x_i &lt; x_j) \\lor \\Big(\\left(x_i = x_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(y_i &lt; y_j \\right) \\Big) $$ <p>Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:</p> $$A_1 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = 0 \\ldots m \\}$$ $$A_2 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = m + 1 \\ldots n-1 \\}.$$ <p>Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \\min(h_1, h_2)$.</p> <p>Now we need to make a merge stage, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$. It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:</p> $$B = \\{ p_i\\ | \\ | x_i - x_m\\ | &lt; h \\}.$$ <p>For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:</p> $$C(p_i) = \\{ p_j\\ |\\ p_j \\in B,\\ \\ y_i - h &lt; y_j \\le y_i \\}.$$ <p>If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.</p> <p>So, in the new notation, the merging stage looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \\in B$ consider all points $p_j \\in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.</p> <p>At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.</p> <p>Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the merging stage, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \\log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort \u2014 it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.</p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"geometry/nearest_points.html#evaluation-of-the-asymptotics","title":"Evaluation of the asymptotics","text":"<p>To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \\log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.</p> <p>So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$.

If there are several of them, we pick the one with the smallest y-coordinate. Let's denote it as $p_0$. Now all other points $p_1,\\dots,p_n$ of the polygon are ordered by their polar angle from the chosen point (because the polygon is ordered counter-clockwise).</p> <p>If the point belongs to the polygon, it belongs to some triangle $p_0, p_i, p_{i + 1}$ (maybe more than one if it lies on the boundary of triangles). Consider the triangle $p_0, p_i, p_{i + 1}$ such that $p$ belongs to this triangle and $i$ is maximum among all such triangles.</p> <p>There is one special case. $p$ lies on the segment $(p_0, p_n)$. This case we will check separately. Otherwise all points $p_j$ with $j \\le i$ are counter-clockwise from $p$ with respect to $p_0$, and all other points are not counter-clockwise from $p$. This means that we can apply binary search for the point $p_i$, such that $p_i$ is not counter-clockwise from $p$ with respect to $p_0$, and $i$ is maximum among all such points.

And if $(a - c) \\times (b - c) &lt; 0$, then the point is to the left, or counter clockwise. And it is exactly on the line between the points $b$ and $c$.</p> <p>Back to the algorithm: Consider a query point $p$. Firstly, we must check if the point lies between $p_1$ and $p_n$. Otherwise we already know that it cannot be part of the polygon. This can be done by checking if the cross product $(p_1 - p_0)\\times(p - p_0)$ is zero or has the same sign with $(p_1 - p_0)\\times(p_n - p_0)$, and $(p_n - p_0)\\times(p - p_0)$ is zero or has the same sign with $(p_n - p_0)\\times(p_1 - p_0)$. Then we handle the special case in which $p$ is part of the line $(p_0, p_1)$. And then we can binary search the last point from $p_1,\\dots p_n$ which is not counter-clockwise from $p$ with respect to $p_0$. For a single point $p_i$ this condition can be checked by checking that $(p_i - p_0)\\times(p - p_0) \\le 0$. After we found such a point $p_i$, we must test if $p$ lies inside the triangle $p_0, p_i, p_{i + 1}$. To test if it belongs to the triangle, we may simply check that $|(p_i - p_0)\\times(p_{i + 1} - p_0)| = |(p_0 - p)\\times(p_i - p)| + |(p_i - p)\\times(p_{i + 1} - p)| + |(p_{i + 1} - p)\\times(p_0 - p)|$. This checks if the area of the triangle $p_0, p_i, p_{i+1}$ has to exact same size as the sum of the sizes of the triangle $p_0, p_i, p$, the triangle $p_0, p, p_{i+1}$ and the triangle $p_i, p_{i+1}, p$. If $p$ is outside, then the sum of those three triangle will be bigger than the size of the triangle.

The following image shows both cases.</p> <p></p> <p>We will solve this problem offline using the sweep line algorithm. Let's iterate over x-coordinates of query points and edges' endpoints in increasing order and keep a set of edges $s$. For each x-coordinate we will add some events beforehand.</p> <p>The events will be of four types: add, remove, vertical, get. For each vertical edge (both endpoints have the same x-coordinate) we will add one vertical event for the corresponding x-coordinate. For every other edge we will add one add event for the minimum of x-coordinates of the endpoints and one remove event for the maximum of x-coordinates of the endpoints. Finally, for each query point we will add one get event for its x-coordinate.</p> <p>For each x-coordinate we will sort the events by their types in order (vertical, get, remove, add).

If the point doesn't lie on any vertical edge, we must find the answer for this query in $t$. To do this, we again make a binary search. In order to handle some degenerate cases (e.g. in case of the triangle $(0,~0)$, $(0,~2)$, $(1, 1)$ when we query the point $(0,~0)$), we must answer all get events again after we processed all the events for this x-coordinate and choose the best of two answers.</li> </ul> <p>Now let's choose a comparator for the set $t$. This comparator should check if one edge doesn't lie above other for every x-coordinate they both cover. Suppose that we have two edges $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$.

How to find the face? If we couldn't find the edge it means that the point is in the outer face. If the point belongs to the edge we found, the face is not unique. Otherwise, there are two candidates - the faces that are bounded by this edge. How to check which one is the answer? Note that the edge is not vertical. Then the answer is the face that is above this edge. Let's find such a face for each non-vertical edge. Consider a counter-clockwise traversal of each face. If during this traversal we increased x-coordinate while passing through the edge, then this face is the face we need to find for this edge.</p>","tags":["Original"]},{"location":"geometry/point-location.html#notes","title":"Notes","text":"<p>Actually, with persistent trees this approach can be used to answer the queries online.</p>","tags":["Original"]},{"location":"geometry/point-location.html#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"<p>The following code is implemented for integers, but it can be easily modified to work with doubles (by changing the compare methods and the point type).

There may be $O(n^2)$ such lines so we obtained $O(n^2)$ stripes. Now consider some vertical stripe. Each non-vertical segment either crosses it from left to right or doesn't cross at all. Also, no two segments intersect strictly inside the stripe. It means that the part of the union of triangles that lies inside this stripe is composed of disjoint trapezoids with bases lying on the sides of the stripe. This property allows us to compute the area inside each stripe with a following scanline algorithm. Each segment crossing the stripe is either upper or lower, depending on whether the interior of the corresponding triangle is above or below the segment. We can visualize each upper segment as an opening bracket and each lower segment as a closing bracket and decompose the stripe into trapezoids by decomposing the bracket sequence into smaller correct bracket sequences.

It means that instead of running vertical scanline for each stripe we can run a horizontal scanline for all parts of other segments which affect the balance of brackets with respect to $s$.

Therefore we can simply intersect these shapes for each vertical stripe and merge these intersections into a single polygon.</p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"geometry/vertical_decomposition.html#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"<p>Below is the code that calculates area of the union of a set of triangles in $O(n^2\\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ memory.</p> <pre><code>typedef double dbl;\n\nconst dbl eps = 1e-9;\n\ninline bool eq(dbl x, dbl y){\n    return fabs(x - y) &lt; eps;\n}\n\ninline bool lt(dbl x, dbl y){\n    return x &lt; y - eps;\n}\n\ninline bool gt(dbl x, dbl y){\n    return x &gt; y + eps;\n}\n\ninline bool le(dbl x, dbl y){\n    return x &lt; y + eps;\n}\n\ninline bool ge(dbl x, dbl y){\n    return x &gt; y - eps;\n}\n\nstruct pt{\n    dbl x, y;\n    inline pt operator - (const pt &amp; p)const{\n        return pt{x - p.x, y - p.y};\n    }\n    inline pt operator + (const pt &amp; p)const{\n        return pt{x + p.x, y + p.y};\n    }\n    inline pt operator * (dbl a)const{\n        return pt{x * a, y * a};\n    }\n    inline dbl cross(const pt &amp; p)const{\n        return x * p.y - y * p.x;\n    }\n    inline dbl dot(const pt &amp; p)const{\n        return x * p.x + y * p.y;\n    }\n    inline bool operator == (const pt &amp; p)const{\n        return eq(x, p.x) &amp;&amp; eq(y, p.y);\n    }\n};\n\nstruct Line{\n    pt p[2];\n    Line(){}\n    Line(pt a, pt b):p{a, b}{}\n    pt vec()const{\n        return p[1] - p[0];\n    }\n    pt&amp; operator [](size_t i){\n        return p[i];\n    }\n};\n\ninline bool lexComp(const pt &amp; l, const pt &amp; r){\n    if(fabs(l.x - r.x) &gt; eps){\n        return l.x &lt; r.x;\n    }\n    else return l.y &lt; r.y;\n}\n\nvector&lt;pt&gt; interSegSeg(Line l1, Line l2){\n    if(eq(l1.vec().cross(l2.vec()), 0)){\n        if(!eq(l1.vec().cross(l2[0] - l1[0]), 0))\n            return {};\n        if(!lexComp(l1[0], l1[1]))\n            swap(l1[0], l1[1]);\n        if(!lexComp(l2[0], l2[1]))\n            swap(l2[0], l2[1]);\n        pt l = lexComp(l1[0], l2[0]) ? l2[0] : l1[0];\n        pt r = lexComp(l1[1], l2[1]) ? l1[1] : l2[1];\n        if(l == r)\n            return {l};\n        else return lexComp(l, r) ? vector&lt;pt&gt;{l, r} : vector&lt;pt&gt;();\n    }\n    else{\n        dbl s = (l2[0] - l1[0]).cross(l2.vec()) / l1.vec().cross(l2.vec());\n        pt inter = l1[0] + l1.vec() * s;\n        if(ge(s, 0) &amp;&amp; le(s, 1) &amp;&amp; le((l2[0] - inter).dot(l2[1] - inter), 0))\n            return {inter};\n        else\n            return {};\n    }\n}\ninline char get_segtype(Line segment, pt other_point){\n    if(eq(segment[0].x, segment[1].x))\n        return 0;\n    if(!lexComp(segment[0], segment[1]))\n        swap(segment[0], segment[1]);\n    return (segment[1] - segment[0]).cross(other_point - segment[0]) &gt; 0 ? 1 : -1;\n}\n\ndbl union_area(vector&lt;tuple&lt;pt, pt, pt&gt; &gt; triangles){\n    vector&lt;Line&gt; segments(3 * triangles.size());\n    vector&lt;char&gt; segtype(segments.size());\n    for(size_t i = 0; i &lt; triangles.size(); i++){\n        pt a, b, c;\n        tie(a, b, c) = triangles[i];\n        segments[3 * i] = lexComp(a, b) ?

It turns out, that this condition is not only necessary, but also sufficient. We will prove this in a few paragraphs below. First recall, if a vertex is reachable from a second one, and the second one is reachable from the first one, then these two vertices are in the same strongly connected component.

In that case the choice of either $\\text{true}$ or $\\text{false}$ for $x$ will lead to a contradiction, while the choice of the other one will not. Let's learn how to choose a value, such that we don't generate a contradiction.</p> <p>Let us sort the strongly connected components in topological order (i.e. $\\text{comp}[v] \\le \\text{comp}[u]$ if there is a path from $v$ to $u$) and let $\\text{comp}[v]$ denote the index of strongly connected component to which the vertex $v$ belongs. Then, if $\\text{comp}[x] &lt; \\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$ we assign $x$ with $\\text{false}$ and $\\text{true}$ otherwise.</p> <p>Let us prove that with this assignment of the variables we do not arrive at a contradiction. Suppose $x$ is assigned with $\\text{true}$. The other case can be proven in a similar way.</p> <p>First we prove that the vertex $x$ cannot reach the vertex $\\lnot x$. Because we assigned $\\text{true}$ it has to hold that the index of strongly connected component of $x$ is greater than the index of the component of $\\lnot x$. This means that $\\lnot x$ is located on the left of the component containing $x$, and the later vertex cannot reach the first.</p> <p>Secondly we prove that there doesn't exist a variable $y$, such that the vertices $y$ and $\\lnot y$ are both reachable from $x$ in the implication graph. This would cause a contradiction, because $x = \\text{true}$ implies that $y = \\text{true}$ and $\\lnot y = \\text{true}$. Let us prove this by contradiction. Suppose that $y$ and $\\lnot y$ are both reachable from $x$, then by the property of the implication graph $\\lnot x$ is reachable from both $y$ and $\\lnot y$. By transitivity this results that $\\lnot x$ is reachable by $x$, which contradicts the assumption.</p> <p>So we have constructed an algorithm that finds the required values of variables under the assumption that for any variable $x$ the vertices $x$ and $\\lnot x$ are in different strongly connected components.

For $k = 0$, we can fill matrix with $d[i][j] = w_{i j}$ if there exists an edge between $i$ and $j$ with weight $w_{i j}$ and $d[i][j] = \\infty$ if there doesn't exist an edge. In practice $\\infty$ will be some high value. As we shall see later, this is a requirement for the algorithm.</p> <p>Suppose now that we are in the $k$-th phase, and we want to compute the matrix $d[ ][ ]$ so that it meets the requirements for the $(k + 1)$-th phase. We have to fix the distances for some vertices pairs $(i, j)$. There are two fundamentally different cases:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The shortest way from the vertex $i$ to the vertex $j$ with internal vertices from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$ coincides with the shortest path with internal vertices from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, k-1\\}$.</p> <p>In this case, $d[i][j]$ will not change during the transition.</p> </li> <li> <p>The shortest path with internal vertices from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$ is shorter.</p> <p>This means that the new, shorter path passes through the vertex $k$. This means that we can split the shortest path between $i$ and $j$ into two paths: the path between $i$ and $k$, and the path between $k$ and $j$. It is clear that both this paths only use internal vertices of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, k-1\\}$ and are the shortest such paths in that respect. Therefore we already have computed the lengths of those paths before, and we can compute the length of the shortest path between $i$ and $j$ as $d[i][k] + d[k][j]$.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Combining these two cases we find that we can recalculate the length of all pairs $(i, j)$ in the $k$-th phase in the following way:</p> $$d_{\\text{new}}[i][j] = min(d[i][j], d[i][k] + d[k][j])$$ <p>Thus, all the work that is required in the $k$-th phase is to iterate over all pairs of vertices and recalculate the length of the shortest path between them. As a result, after the $n$-th phase, the value $d[i][j]$ in the distance matrix is the length of the shortest path between $i$ and $j$, or is $\\infty$ if the path between the vertices $i$ and $j$ does not exist.</p> <p>A last remark - we don't need to create a separate distance matrix $d_{\\text{new}}[ ][ ]$ for temporarily storing the shortest paths of the $k$-th phase, i.e. all changes can be made directly in the matrix $d[ ][ ]$ at any phase. In fact at any $k$-th phase we are at most improving the distance of any path in the distance matrix, hence we cannot worsen the length of the shortest path for any pair of the vertices that are to be processed in the $(k+1)$-th phase or later.</p> <p>The time complexity of this algorithm is obviously $O(n^3)$.</p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/all-pair-shortest-path-floyd-warshall.html#implementation","title":"Implementation","text":"<p>Let $d[][]$ is a 2D array of size $n \\times n$, which is filled according to the $0$-th phase as explained earlier.

Any edge $(u, v)$ of the original graph in this new column will turn into two edges $((u, 0), (v, 1))$ and $((u, 1), (v, 0))$. After that we run a BFS to find the shortest walk from the starting vertex $(s, 0)$ to the end vertex $(t, 0)$.Note: This item uses the term \"walk\" rather than a \"path\" for a reason, as the vertices may potentially repeat in the found walk in order to make its length even. The problem of finding the shortest path of even length is NP-Complete in directed graphs, and solvable in linear time in undirected graphs, but with a much more involved approach.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/breadth-first-search.html#practice-problems","title":"Practice Problems","text":"<ul> <li>SPOJ: AKBAR</li> <li>SPOJ: NAKANJ</li> <li>SPOJ: WATER</li> <li>SPOJ: MICE AND MAZE</li> <li>Timus: Caravans</li> <li>DevSkill - Holloween Party (archived)</li> <li>DevSkill - Ohani And The Link Cut Tree (archived)</li> <li>SPOJ - Spiky Mazes</li> <li>SPOJ - Four Chips (hard)</li> <li>SPOJ - Inversion Sort</li> <li>Codeforces - Shortest Path</li> <li>SPOJ - Yet Another Multiple Problem</li> <li>UVA 11392 - Binary 3xType Multiple</li> <li>UVA 10968 - KuPellaKeS</li> <li>Codeforces - Police Stations</li> <li>Codeforces - Okabe and City</li> <li>SPOJ - Find the Treasure</li> <li>Codeforces - Bear and Forgotten Tree 2</li> <li>Codeforces - Cycle in Maze</li> <li>UVA - 11312 - Flipping Frustration</li> <li>SPOJ - Ada and Cycle</li> <li>CSES - Labyrinth</li> <li>CSES - Message Route</li> <li>CSES - Monsters</li> </ul>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/bridge-searching-online.html","title":"Finding Bridges Online","text":"<p>We are given an undirected graph.

In fact we will make two copies of this structure: one will be to maintain the connected components, the other to maintain the 2-edge-connected components. And in addition we store the structure of the trees in the forest of 2-edge-connected components via pointers: Each 2-edge-connected component will store the index <code>par[]</code> of its ancestor in the tree.</p> <p>We will now consistently disassemble every operation that we need to learn to implement:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Check whether the two vertices lie in the same connected / 2-edge-connected component.     It is done with the usual DSU algorithm, we just find and compare the representatives of the DSUs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Joining two trees for some edge $(a, b)$.     Since it could turn out that neither the vertex $a$ nor the vertex $b$ are the roots of their trees, the only way to connect these two trees is to re-root one of them.     For example you can re-root the tree of vertex $a$, and then attach it to another tree by setting the ancestor of $a$ to $b$.</p> <p>However the question about the effectiveness of the re-rooting operation arises: in order to re-root the tree with the root $r$ to the vertex $v$, it is necessary to visit all vertices on the path between $v$ and $r$ and redirect the pointers <code>par[]</code> in the opposite direction, and also change the references to the ancestors in the DSU that is responsible for the connected components.</p> <p>Thus, the cost of re-rooting is $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree. You can make an even worse estimate by saying that the cost is $O(\\text{size})$ where $\\text{size}$ is the number of vertices in the tree. The final complexity will not differ.</p> <p>We now apply a standard technique: we re-root the tree that contains fewer vertices. Then it is intuitively clear that the worst case is when two trees of approximately equal sizes are combined, but then the result is a tree of twice the size. This does not allow this situation to happen many times.</p> <p>In general the total cost can be written in the form of a recurrence:</p> $$ T(n) = \\max_{k = 1 \\ldots n-1} \\left\\{ T(k) + T(n - k) + O(\\min(k, n - k))\\right\\} $$ <p>$T(n)$ is the number of operations necessary to obtain a tree with $n$ vertices by means of re-rooting and unifying trees. A tree of size $n$ can be created by combining two smaller trees of size $k$ and $n - k$. This recurrence is has the solution $T(n) = O (n \\log n)$.</p> <p>Thus, the total time spent on all re-rooting operations will be $O(n \\log n)$ if we always re-root the smaller of the two trees.</p> <p>We will have to maintain the size of each connected component, but the data structure DSU makes this possible without difficulty.</p> </li> <li> <p>Searching for the cycle formed by adding a new edge $(a, b)$.     Since $a$ and $b$ are already connected in the tree we need to find the Lowest Common Ancestor of the vertices $a$ and $b$.     The cycle will consist of the paths from $b$ to the LCA, from the LCA to $a$ and the edge $a$ to $b$.</p> <p>After finding the cycle we compress all vertices of the detected cycle into one vertex. This means that we already have a complexity proportional to the cycle length, which means that we also can use any LCA algorithm proportional to the length, and don't have to use any fast one.</p> <p>Since all information about the structure of the tree is available is the ancestor array <code>par[]</code>, the only reasonable LCA algorithm is the following: mark the vertices $a$ and $b$ as visited, then we go to their ancestors <code>par[a]</code> and <code>par[b]</code> and mark them, then advance to their ancestors and so on, until we reach an already marked vertex. This vertex is the LCA that we are looking for, and we can find the vertices on the cycle by traversing the path from $a$ and $b$ to the LCA again.</p> <p>It is obvious that the complexity of this algorithm is proportional to the length of the desired cycle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compression of the cycle by adding a new edge $(a, b)$ in a tree.</p> <p>We need to create a new 2-edge-connected component, which will consist of all vertices of the detected cycle (also the detected cycle itself could consist of some 2-edge-connected components, but this does not change anything).

It searches for the LCA of $a$ and $b$ be rising these nodes in parallel, until we meet a vertex for the second time. For efficiency purposes we choose a unique identifier for each LCA finding call, and mark the traversed vertices with it. This works in $O(1)$, while other approaches like using $set$ perform worse. The passed paths are stored in the vectors <code>path_a</code> and <code>path_b</code>, and we use them to walk through them a second time up to the LCA, thereby obtaining all vertices of the cycle. All the vertices of the cycle get compressed by attaching them to the LCA, hence the average complexity is $O(\\log n)$ (since we don't use Union by rank). All the edges we pass have been bridges, so we subtract 1 for each edge in the cycle.</p> <p>Finally the query function <code>add_edge(a, b)</code> determines the connected components in which the vertices $a$ and $b$ lie.

Otherwise if the vertices $a$ and $b$ lie in one tree, but in different 2-edge-connected components, then the function <code>merge_path(a, b)</code> is called, which will detect the cycle and compress it into one 2-edge-connected component. </p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/bridge-searching.html","title":"Finding bridges in a graph in $O(N+M)$","text":"<p>We are given an undirected graph.

Thus, node $v$ must be unvisited when the DFS first explores the edge $(u,v)$ from $u$ to $v$ because otherwise the search would have explored $(u,v)$ from $v$ to $u$ before exiting node $v$, as nodes $u$ and $v$ are neighbors. Therefore, edge $(u,v)$ is a tree edge.</p> </li> <li> <p>The first time we explore the edge $(u,v)$ is in the direction from $v$ to $u$. Because we discovered node $u$ before discovering node $v$, and we only process edges once, the only way that we could explore the edge $(u,v)$ in the direction from $v$ to $u$ is if there's another path from $u$ to $v$ that does not involve the edge $(u,v)$, thus making $u$ an ancestor of $v$.

Therefore, since we perform the first operation $O(n)$ times, and the second one $O(m)$ times, we obtained the complexity $O(n^2 + m)$.</p> <p>It is clear, that this complexity is optimal for a dense graph, i.e. when $m \\approx n^2$. However in sparse graphs, when $m$ is much smaller than the maximal number of edges $n^2$, the complexity gets less optimal because of the first term. Thus it is necessary to improve the execution time of the first operation (and of course without greatly affecting the second operation by much).</p> <p>To accomplish that we can use a variation of multiple auxiliary data structures. The most efficient is the Fibonacci heap, which allows the first operation to run in $O(\\log n)$, and the second operation in $O(1)$. Therefore we will get the complexity $O(n \\log n + m)$ for Dijkstra's algorithm, which is also the theoretical minimum for the shortest path search problem. Therefore this algorithm works optimal, and Fibonacci heaps are the optimal data structure. There doesn't exist any data structure, that can perform both operations in $O(1)$, because this would also allow to sort a list of random numbers in linear time, which is impossible. Interestingly there exists an algorithm by Thorup that finds the shortest path in $O(m)$ time, however only works for integer weights, and uses a completely different idea. So this doesn't lead to any contradictions. Fibonacci heaps provide the optimal complexity for this task. However they are quite complex to implement, and also have a quite large hidden constant.</p> <p>As a compromise you can use data structures, that perform both types of operations (extracting a minimum and updating an item) in $O(\\log n)$. Then the complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is $O(n \\log n + m \\log n) = O(m \\log n)$.</p> <p>C++ provides two such data structures: <code>set</code> and <code>priority_queue</code>. The first is based on red-black trees, and the second one on heaps. Therefore <code>priority_queue</code> has a smaller hidden constant, but also has a drawback: it doesn't support the operation of removing an element.

Fix a phase $i$ and a vertex $v$. Consider any shortest path $P$ from $s$ to $v$ in $G_{i+1}^R$. The length of $P$ equals $level_{i+1}[v]$. Note that $G_{i+1}^R$ can only contain edges from $G_i^R$ and back edges for edges from $G_i^R$. If $P$ has no back edges for $G_i^R$, then $level_{i+1}[v] \\ge level_i[v]$ because $P$ is also a path in $G_i^R$. Now, suppose that $P$ has at least one back edge. Let the first such edge be $(u, w)$.Then $level_{i+1}[u] \\ge level_i[u]$ (because of the first case). The edge $(u, w)$ doesn't belong to $G_i^R$, so the edge $(w, u)$ was affected by the blocking flow on the previous iteration. It means that $level_i[u] = level_i[w] + 1$. Also, $level_{i+1}[w] = level_{i+1}[u] + 1$. From these two equations and $level_{i+1}[u] \\ge level_i[u]$ we obtain $level_{i+1}[w] \\ge level_i[w] + 2$.

This motivates the first flow condition. There cannot flow more water through a pipe than its capacity. The vertices act as junctions, where water comes out of some pipes, and then, these vertices distribute the water in some way to other pipes. This also motivates the second flow condition. All the incoming water has to be distributed to the other pipes in each junction. It cannot magically disappear or appear.

A residual capacity of a directed edge is the capacity minus the flow. It should be noted that if there is a flow along some directed edge $(u, v)$, then the reversed edge has capacity 0 and we can define the flow of it as $f((v, u)) = -f((u, v))$. This also defines the residual capacity for all the reversed edges. We can create a residual network from all these edges, which is just a network with the same vertices and edges, but we use the residual capacities as capacities.</p> <p>The Ford-Fulkerson method works as follows. First, we set the flow of each edge to zero. Then we look for an augmenting path from $s$ to $t$. An augmenting path is a simple path in the residual graph where residual capacity is positive for all the edges along that path. If such a path is found, then we can increase the flow along these edges. We keep on searching for augmenting paths and increasing the flow. Once an augmenting path doesn't exist anymore, the flow is maximal.</p> <p>Let us specify in more detail, what increasing the flow along an augmenting path means. Let $C$ be the smallest residual capacity of the edges in the path. Then we increase the flow in the following way: we update $f((u, v)) ~\\text{+=}~ C$ and $f((v, u)) ~\\text{-=}~ C$ for every edge $(u, v)$ in the path.</p> <p>Here is an example to demonstrate the method. We use the same flow network as above. Initially we start with a flow of 0. </p> <p>We can find the path $s - A - B - t$ with the residual capacities 7, 5, and 8. Their minimum is 5, therefore we can increase the flow along this path by 5. This gives a flow of 5 for the network.  </p> <p>Again we look for an augmenting path, this time we find $s - D - A - C - t$ with the residual capacities 4, 3, 3, and 5. Therefore we can increase the flow by 3 and we get a flow of 8 for the network.  </p> <p>This time we find the path $s - D - C - B - t$ with the residual capacities 1, 2, 3, and 3, and hence, we increase the flow by 1.  </p> <p>This time we find the augmenting path $s - A - D - C - t$ with the residual capacities 2, 3, 1, and 2. We can increase the flow by 1. But this path is very interesting. It includes the reversed edge $(A, D)$. In the original flow network, we are not allowed to send any flow from $A$ to $D$. But because we already have a flow of 3 from $D$ to $A$, this is possible. The intuition of it is the following: Instead of sending a flow of 3 from $D$ to $A$, we only send 2 and compensate this by sending an additional flow of 1 from $s$ to $A$, which allows us to send an additional flow of 1 along the path $D - C - t$.  </p> <p>Now, it is impossible to find an augmenting path between $s$ and $t$, therefore this flow of $10$ is the maximal possible. We have found the maximal flow.</p> <p>It should be noted, that the Ford-Fulkerson method doesn't specify a method of finding the augmenting path. Possible approaches are using DFS or BFS which both work in $O(E)$. If all the capacities of the network are integers, then for each augmenting path the flow of the network increases by at least 1 (for more details see Integral flow theorem). Therefore, the complexity of Ford-Fulkerson is $O(E F)$, where $F$ is the maximal flow of the network. In the case of rational capacities, the algorithm will also terminate, but the complexity is not bounded. In the case of irrational capacities, the algorithm might never terminate, and might not even converge to the maximal flow.</p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/edmonds_karp.html#edmonds-karp-algorithm","title":"Edmonds-Karp algorithm","text":"<p>Edmonds-Karp algorithm is just an implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method that uses BFS for finding augmenting paths.

Since all the elements in $sol$ are in different rows and columns, summing these inequalities over all the selected $A[i][j]$, you get $f$ on the left side of the inequality, and $sol$ on the right side.</p> <p>On the other hand, it turns out that there is always a solution and a potential that turns this inequality into equality. The Hungarian algorithm described below will be a constructive proof of this fact. For now, let's just pay attention to the fact that if any solution has a cost equal to any potential, then this solution is optimal.</p> <p>Let's fix some potential. Let's call an edge $(i,j)$ rigid if $u[i]+v[j]=A[i][j].$</p> <p>Recall an alternative formulation of the assignment problem, using a bipartite graph. Denote with $H$ a bipartite graph composed only of rigid edges. The Hungarian algorithm will maintain, for the current potential, the maximum-number-of-edges matching $M$ of the graph $H$. As soon as $M$ contains $n$ edges, then the solution to the problem will be just $M$ (after all, it will be a solution whose cost coincides with the value of a potential).</p> <p>Let's proceed directly to the description of the algorithm.</p> <p>Step 1. At the beginning, the potential is assumed to be zero ($u[i]=v[i]=0$ for all $i$), and the matching $M$ is assumed to be empty.</p> <p>Step 2. Further, at each step of the algorithm, we try, without changing the potential, to increase the cardinality of the current matching $M$ by one (recall that the matching is searched in the graph of rigid edges $H$). To do this, the usual Kuhn Algorithm for finding the maximum matching in bipartite graphs is used. Let us recall the algorithm here. All edges of the matching $M$ are oriented in the direction from the right part to the left one, and all other edges of the graph $H$ are oriented in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Recall (from the terminology of searching for matchings) that a vertex is called saturated if an edge of the current matching is adjacent to it. A vertex that is not adjacent to any edge of the current matching is called unsaturated. A path of odd length, in which the first edge does not belong to the matching, and for all subsequent edges there is an alternating belonging to the matching (belongs/does not belong) - is called an augmenting path. From all unsaturated vertices in the left part, a depth-first or breadth-first traversal is started. If, as a result of the search, it was possible to reach an unsaturated vertex of the right part, we have found an augmenting path from the left part to the right one. If we include odd edges of the path and remove the even ones in the matching (i.e. include the first edge in the matching, exclude the second, include the third, etc.), then we will increase the matching cardinality by one.</p> <p>If there was no augmenting path, then the current matching $M$ is maximal in the graph $H$.</p> <p>Step 3. If at the current step, it is not possible to increase the cardinality of the current matching, then a recalculation of the potential is performed in such a way that, at the next steps, there will be more opportunities to increase the matching.</p> <p>Denote by $Z_1$ the set of vertices of the left part that were visited during the last traversal of Kuhn's algorithm, and through $Z_2$ the set of visited vertices of the right part.</p> <p>Let's calculate the value $\\Delta$:</p> $$\\Delta = \\min_{i\\in Z_1,\\ j\\notin Z_2} A[i][j]-u[i]-v[j].$$ <p>Lemma. $\\Delta &gt; 0.$</p> Proof <p>Suppose $\\Delta=0$. Then there exists a rigid edge $(i,j)$ with $i\\in Z_1$ and $j\\notin Z_2$. It follows that the edge $(i,j)$ must be oriented from the right part to the left one, i.e. $(i,j)$ must be included in the matching $M$. However, this is impossible, because we could not get to the saturated vertex $i$ except by going along the edge from j to i. So $\\Delta &gt; 0$.</p> <p>Now let's recalculate the potential in this way:</p> <ul> <li> <p>for all vertices $i\\in Z_1$, do $u[i] \\gets u[i]+\\Delta$,</p> </li> <li> <p>for all vertices $j\\in Z_2$, do $v[j] \\gets v[j]-\\Delta$.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Lemma. The resulting potential is still a correct potential.</p> Proof <p>We will show that, after recalculation, $u[i]+v[j]\\leq A[i][j]$ for all $i,j$. For all the elements of $A$ with $i\\in Z_1$ and $j\\in Z_2$, the sum $u[i]+v[j]$ does not change, so the inequality remains true. For all the elements with $i\\notin Z_1$ and $j\\in Z_2$, the sum $u[i]+v[j]$ decreases by $\\Delta$, so the inequality is still true. For the other elements whose $i\\in Z_1$ and $j\\notin Z_2$, the sum increases, but the inequality is still preserved, since the value $\\Delta$ is, by definition, the maximum increase that does not change the inequality.</p> <p>Lemma. The old matching $M$ of rigid edges is valid, i.e. all edges of the matching will remain rigid.</p> Proof <p>For some rigid edge $(i,j)$ to stop being rigid as a result of a change in potential, it is necessary that equality $u[i] + v[j] = A[i][j]$ turns into inequality $u[i] + v[j] &lt; A[i][j]$. However, this can happen only when $i \\notin Z_1$ and $j \\in Z_2$. But $i \\notin Z_1$ implies that the edge $(i,j)$ could not be a matching edge.</p> <p>Lemma. After each recalculation of the potential, the number of vertices reachable by the traversal, i.e. $|Z_1|+|Z_2|$, strictly increases.</p> Proof <p>First, note that any vertex that was reachable before recalculation, is still reachable. Indeed, if some vertex is reachable, then there is some path from reachable vertices to it, starting from the unsaturated vertex of the left part; since for edges of the form $(i,j),\\ i\\in Z_1,\\ j\\in Z_2$ the sum $u[i]+v[j]$ does not change, this entire path will be preserved after changing the potential. Secondly, we show that after a recalculation, at least one new vertex will be reachable. This follows from the definition of $\\Delta$: the edge $(i,j)$ which $\\Delta$ refers to will become rigid, so vertex $j$ will be reachable from vertex $i$.</p> <p>Due to the last lemma, no more than $n$ potential recalculations can occur before an augmenting path is found and the matching cardinality of $M$ is increased. Thus, sooner or later, a potential that corresponds to a perfect matching $M^*$ will be found, and $M^*$ will be the answer to the problem. If we talk about the complexity of the algorithm, then it is $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$: in total there should be at most $n$ increases in matching, before each of which there are no more than $n$ potential recalculations, each of which is performed in time $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.</p> <p>We will not give the implementation for the $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ algorithm here, since it will turn out to be no shorter than the implementation for the $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ one, described below.</p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/hungarian-algorithm.html#the-mathcalon3-algorithm","title":"The $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ algorithm","text":"<p>Now let's learn how to implement the same algorithm in $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ (for rectangular problems $n \\times m$, $\\mathcal{O}(n^2m)$).</p> <p>The key idea is to consider matrix rows one by one, and not all at once.

To solve it, we simply build an assignment problem, putting the number \"infinity\" in place of the missing edges. After that, we solve the problem with the Hungarian algorithm, and remove edges of infinite weight from the answer (they could enter the answer if the problem does not have a solution in the form of a perfect matching).</p> </li> <li> <p>Given a bipartite graph, it is required to find in it the maximum matching with the maximum weight.   The solution is again obvious, all weights must be multiplied by minus one.</p> </li> <li> <p>The task of detecting moving objects in images: two images were taken, as a result of which two sets of coordinates were obtained. It is required to correlate the objects in the first and second images, i.e. determine for each point of the second image, which point of the first image it corresponded to. In this case, it is required to minimize the sum of distances between the compared points (i.e., we are looking for a solution in which the objects have taken the shortest path in total).   To solve, we simply build and solve an assignment problem, where the weights of the edges are the Euclidean distances between points.</p> </li> <li> <p>The task of detecting moving objects by locators: there are two locators that can't determine the position of an object in space, but only its direction. Both locators (located at different points) received information in the form of $n$ such directions. It is required to determine the position of objects, i.e. determine the expected positions of objects and their corresponding pairs of directions in such a way that the sum of distances from objects to direction rays is minimized.   Solution: again, we simply build and solve the assignment problem, where the vertices of the left part are the $n$ directions from the first locator, the vertices of the right part are the $n$ directions from the second locator, and the weights of the edges are the distances between the corresponding rays.</p> </li> <li> <p>Covering a directed acyclic graph with paths: given a directed acyclic graph, it is required to find the smallest number of paths (if equal, with the smallest total weight) so that each vertex of the graph lies in exactly one path.   The solution is to build the corresponding bipartite graph from the given graph and find the maximum matching of the minimum weight in it. See separate article for more details.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tree coloring book. Given a tree in which each vertex, except for leaves, has exactly $k-1$ children. It is required to choose for each vertex one of the $k$ colors available so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. In addition, for each vertex and each color, the cost of painting this vertex with this color is known, and it is required to minimize the total cost.   To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming. Namely, let's learn how to calculate the value $d[v][c]$, where $v$ is the vertex number, $c$ is the color number, and the value $d[v][c]$ itself is the minimum cost needed to color all the vertices in the subtree rooted at $v$, and the vertex $v$ itself with color $c$. To calculate such a value $d[v][c]$, it is necessary to distribute the remaining $k-1$ colors among the children of the vertex $v$, and for this, it is necessary to build and solve the assignment problem (in which the vertices of the left part are colors, the vertices of the right part are children, and the weights of the edges are the corresponding values of $d$).   Thus, each value $d[v][c]$ is calculated using the solution of the assignment problem, which ultimately gives the asymptotic $\\mathcal{O}(nk^4)$.</p> </li> <li> <p>If, in the assignment problem, the weights are not on the edges, but on the vertices, and only on the vertices of the same part, then it's not necessary to use the Hungarian algorithm: just sort the vertices by weight and run the usual Kuhn algorithm (for more details, see a separate article).</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the following special case. Let each vertex of the left part be assigned some number $\\alpha[i]$, and each vertex of the right part $\\beta[j]$. Let the weight of any edge $(i,j)$ be equal to $\\alpha[i]\\cdot \\beta[j]$ (the numbers $\\alpha[i]$ and $\\beta[j]$ are known). Solve the assignment problem.   To solve it without the Hungarian algorithm, we first consider the case when both parts have two vertices. In this case, as you can easily see, it is better to connect the vertices in the reverse order: connect the vertex with the smaller $\\alpha[i]$ to the vertex with the larger $\\beta[j]$. This rule can be easily generalized to an arbitrary number of vertices: you need to sort the vertices of the first part in increasing order of $\\alpha[i]$ values, the second part in decreasing order of $\\beta[j]$ values, and connect the vertices in pairs in that order. Thus, we obtain a solution with complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Problem of Potentials. Given a matrix $A[1 \\ldots n][1 \\ldots m]$, it is required to find two arrays $u[1 \\ldots n]$ and $v[1 \\ldots m]$ such that, for any $i$ and $j$, $u[i] + v[j] \\leq a[i][j]$ and the sum of elements of arrays $u$ and $v$ is maximum.   Knowing the Hungarian algorithm, the solution to this problem will not be difficult: the Hungarian algorithm just finds such a potential $u, v$ that satisfies the condition of the problem. On the other hand, without knowledge of the Hungarian algorithm, it seems almost impossible to solve such a problem.</p> <p>Remark</p> <p>This task is also called the dual problem of the assignment problem: minimizing the total cost of the assignment is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the potentials.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/hungarian-algorithm.html#literature","title":"Literature","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Ravindra Ahuja, Thomas Magnanti, James Orlin.

Since when calling the function $\\textrm{try_kuhn}$ in the main loop, it is assumed that the current vertex is  not yet included in the matching, you need to add an appropriate check.</p> <p>In the implementation, only the code in the $\\textrm{main}()$ function will change:</p> <pre><code>int main() {\n    // ... reading the graph ...\n\n    mt.assign(k, -1);\n    vector&lt;bool&gt; used1(n, false);\n    for (int v = 0; v &lt; n; ++v) {\n        for (int to : g[v]) {\n            if (mt[to] == -1) {\n                mt[to] = v;\n                used1[v] = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    for (int v = 0; v &lt; n; ++v) {\n        if (used1[v])\n            continue;\n        used.assign(n, false);\n        try_kuhn(v);\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; k; ++i)\n        if (mt[i] != -1)\n            printf(\"%d %d\\n\", mt[i] + 1, i + 1);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Another good heuristic is as follows. At each step, it will search for the vertex of the smallest degree (but not isolated), select any edge from it and add it to the matching, then remove both these vertices with all incident edges from the graph. Such greed works very well on random graphs; in many cases it even builds the maximum matching (although  there is a test case against it, on which it will find a matching that is much smaller than the maximum).</p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/kuhn_maximum_bipartite_matching.html#notes","title":"Notes","text":"<ul> <li>Kuhn's algorithm is a subroutine in the Hungarian algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.</li> <li>Kuhn's algorithm runs in $O(nm)$ time.

We make a DFS traversal starting at the root and we build a list $\\text{euler}$ which stores the order of the vertices that we visit (a vertex is added to the list when we first visit it, and after the return of the DFS traversals to its children). This is also called an Euler tour of the tree. It is clear that the size of this list will be $O(N)$. We also need to build an array $\\text{first}[0..N-1]$ which stores for each vertex $i$ its first occurrence in $\\text{euler}$. That is, the first position in $\\text{euler}$ such that $\\text{euler}[\\text{first}[i]] = i$. Also by using the DFS we can find the height of each node (distance from root to it) and store it in the array $\\text{height}[0..N-1]$.</p> <p>So how can we answer queries using the Euler tour and the additional two arrays? Suppose the query is a pair of $v_1$ and $v_2$. Consider the vertices that we visit in the Euler tour between the first visit of $v_1$ and the first visit of $v_2$. It is easy to see, that the $\\text{LCA}(v_1, v_2)$ is the vertex with the lowest height on this path. We already noticed, that the LCA has to be part of the shortest path between $v_1$ and $v_2$. Clearly it also has to be the vertex with the smallest height. And in the Euler tour we essentially use the shortest path, except that we additionally visit all subtrees that we find on the path. But all vertices in these subtrees are lower in the tree than the LCA and therefore have a larger height. So the $\\text{LCA}(v_1, v_2)$ can be uniquely determined by finding the vertex with the smallest height in the Euler tour between $\\text{first}(v_1)$ and $\\text{first}(v_2)$.</p> <p>Let's illustrate this idea. Consider the following graph and the Euler tour with the corresponding heights: </p> $$\\begin{array}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline \\text{Vertices:}   &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 7 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\hline \\text{Heights:} &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}$$ <p>The tour starting at vertex $6$ and ending at $4$ we visit the vertices $[6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4]$. Among those vertices the vertex $1$ has the lowest height, therefore $\\text{LCA(6, 4) = 1}$.</p> <p>To recap: to answer a query we just need to find the vertex with smallest height in the array $\\text{euler}$ in the range from $\\text{first}[v_1]$ to $\\text{first}[v_2]$.

The Farach-Colton and Bender algorithm describes a solution for exactly this specialized RMQ problem.</p> <p>Let's denote with $A$ the array on which we want to perform the range minimum queries. And $N$ will be the size of $A$.</p> <p>There is an easy data structure that we can use for solving the RMQ problem with $O(N \\log N)$ preprocessing and $O(1)$ for each query: the Sparse Table. We create a table $T$ where each element $T[i][j]$ is equal to the minimum of $A$ in the interval $[i, i + 2^j - 1]$. Obviously $0 \\leq j \\leq \\lceil \\log N \\rceil$, and therefore the size of the Sparse Table will be $O(N \\log N)$. You can build the table easily in $O(N \\log N)$ by noting that $T[i][j] = \\min(T[i][j-1], T[i+2^{j-1}][j-1])$.</p> <p>How can we answer a query RMQ in $O(1)$ using this data structure? Let the received query be $[l, r]$, then the answer is $\\min(T[l][\\text{sz}], T[r-2^{\\text{sz}}+1][\\text{sz}])$, where $\\text{sz}$ is the biggest exponent such that $2^{\\text{sz}}$ is not bigger than the range length $r-l+1$.  Indeed we can take the range $[l, r]$ and cover it two segments of length $2^{\\text{sz}}$ - one starting in $l$ and the other ending in $r$. These segments overlap, but this doesn't interfere with our computation. To really achieve the time complexity of $O(1)$ per query, we need to know the values of $\\text{sz}$ for all possible lengths from $1$ to $N$. But this can be easily precomputed.</p> <p>Now we want to improve the complexity of the preprocessing down to $O(N)$.</p> <p>We divide the array $A$ into blocks of size $K = 0.5 \\log N$ with $\\log$ being the logarithm to base 2. For each block we calculate the minimum element and store them in an array $B$. $B$ has the size $\\frac{N}{K}$. We construct a sparse table from the array $B$. The size and the time complexity of it will be:</p> $$\\frac{N}{K}\\log\\left(\\frac{N}{K}\\right) = \\frac{2N}{\\log(N)} \\log\\left(\\frac{2N}{\\log(N)}\\right) =$$ $$= \\frac{2N}{\\log(N)} \\left(1 + \\log\\left(\\frac{N}{\\log(N)}\\right)\\right) \\leq \\frac{2N}{\\log(N)} + 2N = O(N)$$ <p>Now we only have to learn how to quickly answer range minimum queries within each block. In fact if the received range minimum query is $[l, r]$ and $l$ and $r$ are in different blocks then the answer is the minimum of the following three values: the minimum of the suffix of block of $l$ starting at $l$, the minimum of the prefix of block of $r$ ending at $r$, and the minimum of the blocks between those. The minimum of the blocks in between can be answered in $O(1)$ using the Sparse Table. So this leaves us only the range minimum queries inside blocks.</p> <p>Here we will exploit the property of the array. Remember that the values in the array - which are just height values in the tree - will always differ by one. If we remove the first element of a block, and subtract it from every other item in the block, every block can be identified by a sequence of length $K - 1$ consisting of the number $+1$ and $-1$. Because these blocks are so small, there are only a few different sequences that can occur.

For the implementation we can characterize a block by a bitmask of length $K-1$ (which will fit in a standard int) and store the index of the minimum in an array $\\text{block}[\\text{mask}][l][r]$ of size $O(\\sqrt{N} \\log^2(N))$.</p> <p>So we learned how to precompute range minimum queries within each block, as well as range minimum queries over a range of blocks, all in $O(N)$.

Namely a query $(u, v)$ is answered at node $u$, if node $v$ has already been visited previously, or vice versa.</p> <p>So let's assume we are currently at node $v$, we have already made recursive DFS calls, and also already visited the second node $u$ from the query $(u, v)$. Let's learn how to find the LCA of these two nodes.</p> <p>Note that $\\text{LCA}(u, v)$ is either the node $v$ or one of its ancestors. So we need to find the lowest node among the ancestors of $v$ (including $v$), for which the node $u$ is a descendant.  Also note that for a fixed $v$ the visited nodes of the tree split into a set of disjoint sets.  Each ancestor $p$ of node $v$ has his own set containing this node and all subtrees with roots in those of its children who are not part of the path from $v$ to the root of the tree. The set which contains the node $u$ determines the $\\text{LCA}(u, v)$: the LCA is the representative of the set, namely the node on lies on the path between $v$ and the root of the tree.</p> <p>We only need to learn to efficiently maintain all these sets.

To be able to apply Union by rank, we store the real representative (the value on the path between $v$ and the root of the tree) of each set in the array <code>ancestor</code>.</p> <p>Let's discuss the implementation of the DFS. Let's assume we are currently visiting the node $v$. We place the node in a new set in the DSU, <code>ancestor[v] = v</code>. As usual we process all children of $v$. For this we must first recursively call DFS from that node, and then add this node with all its subtree to the set of $v$. This can be done with the function <code>union_sets</code> and the following assignment <code>ancestor[find_set(v)] = v</code> (this is necessary, because <code>union_sets</code> might change the representative of the set).</p> <p>Finally after processing all children we can answer all queries of the form $(u, v)$ for which $u$ has been already visited. The answer to the query, i.e. the LCA of $u$ and $v$, will be the node <code>ancestor[find_set(u)]</code>. It is easy to see that a query will only be answered once.</p> <p>Let's us determine the time complexity of this algorithm.  Firstly we have $O(n)$ because of the DFS. Secondly  we have the function calls of <code>union_sets</code> which happen $n$ times, resulting also in $O(n)$. And thirdly we have the calls of <code>find_set</code> for every query, which gives $O(m)$.

If there doesn't exists a path anymore, then the algorithm terminates, and the stream $F$ is the desired one. If a path was found, we increase the flow along it as much as possible (i.e. we find the minimal residual capacity $R$ of the path, and increase the flow by it, and reduce the back edges by the same amount).

The main difference from Dinic's is how we find the blocking flow. Consider the layered network $L$. For each node we define its' inner potential and outer potential as:</p> $$\\begin{align} p_{in}(v) &amp;= \\sum\\limits_{(u, v)\\in L}(c(u, v) - f(u, v)) \\\\\\\\ p_{out}(v) &amp;= \\sum\\limits_{(v, u)\\in L}(c(v, u) - f(v, u)) \\end{align}$$ <p>Also we set $p_{in}(s) = p_{out}(t) = \\infty$.

We claim that the flow can be increased by $p(r)$ in such a way that $p(r)$ becomes $0$. It is true because $L$ is acyclic, so we can push the flow out of $r$ by outgoing edges and it will reach $t$ because each node has enough outer potential to push the flow out when it reaches it. Similarly, we can pull the flow from $s$. The construction of the blocked flow is based on this fact. On each iteration we find a reference node and push the flow from $s$ to $t$ through $r$. This process can be simulated by BFS. All completely saturated arcs can be deleted from $L$ as they won't be used later in this phase anyway.

However after a closer look, this is actually not true. The number of leafs will not increase. Either the number decreases by one (we remove one leaf vertex and don't gain a new one), or it stay the same (we remove one leaf vertex and gain another one). In the first case there is no other way than searching for the next smallest leaf vertex.

And in quite a lot of times we can continue with the new leaf vertex.</p> <p>To do this we will use a variable $\\text{ptr}$, which will indicate that in the set of vertices between $0$ and $\\text{ptr}$ is at most one leaf vertex, namely the current one.

And in the second case, we can further distinguish two cases: Either the newly gained leaf vertex is smaller than $\\text{ptr}$, then this must be the next leaf vertex, since we know that there are no other vertices smaller than $\\text{ptr}$.

We say that this vertex has some excess flow, and define the amount of it with the excess function $x(u) =\\sum_{(v, u) \\in E} f((v, u)) - \\sum_{(u, v) \\in E} f((u, v))$.</p> <p>In the same way as with the flow function, we can define the residual capacities and the residual graph with the preflow function.</p> <p>The algorithm will start off with an initial preflow (some vertices having excess), and during the execution the preflow will be handled and modified. Giving away some details already, the algorithm will pick a vertex with excess, and push the excess to neighboring vertices. It will repeat this until all vertices, except the source and the sink, are free from excess. It is easy to see, that a preflow without excess is a valid flow. This makes the algorithm terminate with an actual flow.</p> <p>There are still two problem, we have to deal with. First, how do we guarantee that this actually terminates? And secondly, how do we guarantee that this will actually give us a maximum flow, and not just any random flow?</p> <p>To solve these problems we need the help of another function, namely the labeling functions $h$, often also called height function, which assigns each vertex an integer. We call a labeling is valid, if $h(s) = |V|$, $h(t) = 0$, and $h(u) \\le h(v) + 1$ if there is an edge $(u, v)$ in the residual graph - i.e. the edge $(u, v)$ has a positive capacity in the residual graph. In other words, if it is possible to increase the flow from $u$ to $v$, then the height of $v$ can be at most one smaller than the height of $u$, but it can be equal or even higher.</p> <p>It is important to note, that if there exists a valid labeling function, then there doesn't exist an augmenting path from $s$ to $t$ in the residual graph. Because such a path will have a length of at most $|V| - 1$ edges, and each edge can decrease the height only by at most by one, which is impossible if the first height is $h(s) = |V|$ and the last height is $h(t) = 0$.</p> <p>Using this labeling function we can state the strategy of the push-relabel algorithm: We start with a valid preflow and a valid labeling function. In each step we push some excess between vertices, and update the labels of vertices. We have to make sure, that after each step the preflow and the labeling are still valid. If then the algorithm determines, the preflow is a valid flow. And because we also have a valid labeling, there doesn't exists a path between $s$ and $t$ in the residual graph, which means that the flow is actually a maximum flow.</p> <p>If we compare the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with the push-relabel algorithm it seems like the algorithms are the duals of each other. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm keeps a valid flow at all time and improves it until there doesn't exists an augmenting path any more, while in the push-relabel algorithm there doesn't exists an augmenting path at any time, and we will improve the preflow until it is a valid flow.</p>","tags":["Translated"]},{"location":"graph/push-relabel.html#algorithm","title":"Algorithm","text":"<p>First we have to initialize the graph with a valid preflow and labeling function.</p> <p>Using the empty preflow - like it is done in the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm - is not possible, because then there will be an augmenting path and this implies that there doesn't exists a valid labeling. Therefore we will initialize each edges outgoing from $s$ with its maximal capacity: $f((s, u)) = c((s, u))$. And all other edges with zero. In this case there exists a valid labeling, namely $h(s) = |V|$ for the source vertex and $h(u) = 0$ for all other.</p> <p>Now let's describe the two operations in more detail.</p> <p>With the <code>push</code> operation we try to push as much excess flow from one vertex $u$ to a neighboring vertex $v$. We have one rule: we are only allowed to push flow from $u$ to $v$ if $h(u) = h(v) + 1$. In layman's terms, the excess flow has to flow downwards, but not too steeply. Of course we only can push $\\min(x(u), c((u, v)) - f((u, v)))$ flow.</p> <p>If a vertex has excess, but it is not possible to push the excess to any adjacent vertex, then we need to increase the height of this vertex.

It is based on two series of depth first search, with a runtime of $O(n + m)$.</p> <p>In the first step of the algorithm, we perform a sequence of depth first searches (<code>dfs</code>), visiting the entire graph. That is, as long as there are still unvisited vertices, we take one of them, and initiate a depth first search from that vertex. For each vertex, we keep track of the exit time $t_\\text{out}[v]$. This is the 'timestamp' at which the execution of <code>dfs</code> on vertex $v$ finishes, i.e., the moment at which all vertices reachable from $v$ have been visited and the algorithm is back at $v$. The timestamp counter should not be reset between consecutive calls to <code>dfs</code>. The exit times play a key role in the algorithm, which will become clear when we discuss the following theorem.</p> <p>First, we define the exit time $t_\\text{out}[C]$ of a strongly connected component $C$ as the maximum of the values $t_\\text{out}[v]$ for all $v \\in C.$ Furthermore, in the proof of the theorem, we will mention the entry time $t_{\\text{in}}[v]$ for each vertex $v\\in G$. The number $t_{\\text{in}}[v]$ represents the 'timestamp' at which the recursive function <code>dfs</code> is called on vertex $v$ in the first step of the algorithm. For a strongly connected component $C$, we define $t_{\\text{in}}[C]$ to be the minimum of the values $t_{\\text{in}}[v]$ for all $v \\in C$.</p> <p>Theorem. Let $C$ and $C'$ be two different strongly connected components, and let there be an edge from $C$ to $C'$ in the condensation graph. Then, $t_\\text{out}[C] &gt; t_\\text{out}[C']$.</p> <p>Proof. There are two different cases, depending on which component will first be reached by depth first search:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Case 1: the component $C$ was reached first (i.e., $t_{\\text{in}}[C] &lt; t_{\\text{in}}[C']$). In this case, depth first search visits some vertex $v \\in C$ at some moment at which all other vertices of the components $C$ and $C'$ are not visited yet. Since there is an edge from $C$ to $C'$ in the condensation graph, not only are all other vertices in $C$ reachable from $v$ in $G$, but all vertices in $C'$ are reachable as well. This means that this <code>dfs</code> execution, which is running from vertex $v$, will also visit all other vertices of the components $C$ and $C'$ in the future, so these vertices will be descendants of $v$ in the depth first search tree. This implies that for each vertex $u \\in (C \\cup C')\\setminus \\{v\\},$ we have that $t_\\text{out}[v] &gt; t_\\text{out}[u]$. Therefore, $t_\\text{out}[C] &gt; t_\\text{out}[C']$, which completes this case of the proof.</p> </li> <li> <p>Case 2: the component $C'$ was reached first (i.e., $t_{\\text{in}}[C] &gt; t_{\\text{in}}[C']$). In this case, depth first search visits some vertex $v \\in C'$ at some moment at which all other vertices of the components $C$ and $C'$ are not visited yet. Since there is an edge from $C$ to $C'$ in the condensation graph, $C$ is not reachable from $C'$, by the acyclicity property. Hence, the <code>dfs</code> execution that is running from vertex $v$ will not reach any vertices of $C$, but it will visit all vertices of $C'$. The vertices of $C$ will be visited by some <code>dfs</code> execution later during this step of the algorithm, so indeed we have $t_\\text{out}[C] &gt; t_\\text{out}[C']$. This completes the proof.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The proved theorem is very important for finding strongly connected components. It means that any edge in the condensation graph goes from a component with a larger value of $t_\\text{out}$ to a component with a smaller value.</p> <p>If we sort all vertices $v \\in V$ in decreasing order of their exit time $t_\\text{out}[v]$, then the first vertex $u$ will belong to the \"root\" strongly connected component, which has no incoming edges in the condensation graph. Now we want to run some type of search from this vertex $u$ so that it will visit all vertices in its strongly connected component, but not other vertices. By repeatedly doing so, we can gradually find all strongly connected components: we remove all vertices belonging to the first found component, then we find the next remaining vertex with the largest value of $t_\\text{out}$, and run this search from it, and so on. In the end, we will have found all strongly connected components. In order to find a search method that behaves like we want, we consider the following theorem:</p> <p>Theorem. Let $G^T$ denote the transpose graph of $G$, obtained by reversing the edge directions in $G$. Then, $\\text{SCC}(G)=\\text{SCC}(G^T)$. Furthermore, the condensation graph of $G^T$ is the transpose of the condensation graph of $G$.</p> <p>The proof is omitted (but straightforward). As a consequence of this theorem, there will be no edges from the \"root\" component to the other components in the condensation graph of $G^T$. Thus, in order to visit the whole \"root\" strongly connected component, containing vertex $v$, we can just run a depth first search from vertex $v$ in the transpose graph $G^T$! This will visit precisely all vertices of this strongly connected component. As was mentioned before, we can then remove these vertices from the graph. Then, we find the next vertex with a maximal value of $t_\\text{out}[v]$, and run the search in the transpose graph starting from that vertex to find the next strongly connected component. Repeating this, we find all strongly connected components.</p> <p>Thus, in summary, we discussed the following algorithm to find strongly connected components:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Step 1. Run a sequence of depth first searches on $G$, which will yield some list (e.g. <code>order</code>) of vertices, sorted on increasing exit time $t_\\text{out}$.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 2. Build the transpose graph $G^T$, and run a series of depth first searches on the vertices in reverse order (i.e., in decreasing order of exit times). Each depth first search will yield one strongly connected component.</p> </li> <li> <p>Step 3 (optional). Build the condensation graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The runtime complexity of the algorithm is $O(n + m)$, because depth first search is performed twice.

The answer of the query $(i,j)$ will be the sum of both subqueries. Both these queries have a special structure, the first vertex is an ancestor of the second one. For the rest of the article we will only talk about these special kind of queries.</p> <p>We will start by describing the preprocessing step. Run a depth-first search from the root of the tree and record the Euler tour of this depth-first search (each vertex is added to the list when the search visits it first and every time we return from one of its children). The same technique can be used in the LCA preprocessing.</p> <p>This list will contain each edge (in the sense that if $i$ and $j$ are the ends of the edge, then there will be a place in the list where $i$ and $j$ are neighbors in the list), and it appear exactly two times: in the forward direction (from $i$ to $j$, where vertex $i$ is closer to the root than vertex $j$) and in the opposite direction (from $j$ to $i$).</p> <p>We will build two lists for these edges. The first one will store the color of all edges in the forward direction, and the second one the color of all edges in the opposite direction.

We need to determine how many edges are painted on the path between $i$ and $j$. Let's find $i$ and $j$ in the Euler tour for the first time, let it be the positions $p$ and $q$ (this can be done in $O(1)$ if we calculate these positions in advance during preprocessing). Then the answer to the query is the sum $T1[p..q-1]$ minus the sum $T2[p..q-1]$.</p> <p>Why? Consider the segment $[p;q]$ in the Euler tour. It contains all edges of the path we need from $i$ to $j$ but also contains a set of edges that lie on other paths from $i$. However there is one big difference between the edges we need and the rest of the edges: the edges we need will be listed only once in the forward direction, and all the other edges appear twice: once in the forward and once in the opposite direction. Hence, the difference $T1[p..q-1] - T2[p..q-1]$ will give us the correct answer (minus one is necessary because otherwise, we will capture an extra edge going out from vertex $j$). The sum query in the segment tree is executed in $O(\\log N)$.</p> <p>Answering the first type of query (painting an edge) is even easier - we just need to update $T1$ and $T2$, namely to perform a single update of the element that corresponds to our edge (finding the edge in the list, again, is possible in $O(1)$, if you perform this search during preprocessing).

Because the array is sorted, we can deduce that $k$ either occurs among $A_L, A_{L+1}, \\dots, A_R$ or doesn't occur in the array at all. If we pick an arbitrary index $M$ such that $L &lt; M &lt; R$ and check whether $k$ is less or greater than $A_M$. We have two possible cases:</p> <ol> <li>$A_L \\leq k \\leq A_M$.

Otherwise we would want to pick $M$ in such manner that it reduces the active segment to a single element as quickly as possible in the worst case.</p> <p>Since in the worst case we will always reduce to larger segment of $[L, M]$ and $[M, R]$. Thus, in the worst case scenario the reduction would be from $R-L$ to $\\max(M-L, R-M)$. To minimize this value, we should pick $M \\approx \\frac{L+R}{2}$, then</p> $$ M-L \\approx \\frac{R-L}{2} \\approx R-M. $$ <p>In other words, from the worst-case scenario perspective it is optimal to always pick $M$ in the middle of $[L, R]$ and split it in half. Thus, the active segment halves on each step until it becomes of size $1$. So, if the process needs $h$ steps, in the end it reduces the difference between $R$ and $L$ from $R-L$ to $\\frac{R-L}{2^h} \\approx 1$, giving us the equation $2^h \\approx R-L$.</p> <p>Taking $\\log_2$ on both sides, we get $h \\approx \\log_2(R-L) \\in O(\\log n)$.</p> <p>Logarithmic number of steps is drastically better than that of linear search.

Proving ordering is simple. We note that the mediant of two fractions is always in-between the fractions</p> $$     \\frac{a}{b} \\le \\frac{a+c}{b+d} \\le \\frac{c}{d} $$ <p>given that</p> $$     \\frac{a}{b} \\le \\frac{c}{d}. $$ <p>The two inequalities can be easily shown by rewriting the fractions with common denominators.</p> <p>As the ordering is ascending in the zeroth iteration, it will be maintained at every subsequent iteration.</p> <p>Irreducibility. To prove this we will show that for any two adjacent fractions $\\frac{a}{b}$ and $\\frac{c}{d}$ we have that</p> $$     bc - ad = 1. $$ <p>Recall that a Diophantine equation with two variables $ax+by=c$ has a solution iff $c$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(a,b)$. In our case this implies that $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(c,d) = 1$, which is what we want to show.</p> <p>Clearly at the zeroth iteration $bc - ad = 1$. What remains to be shown is that mediants retain this property.</p> <p>Assume our two adjacent fractions uphold $bc - ad = 1$, after the mediant is added to the list</p> $$     \\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{a+c}{b+d}, \\frac{c}{d} $$ <p>the new expressions become</p> $$\\begin{align}     b(a+c) - a(b+d) &amp;= 1 \\\\     c(b+d) - d(a+c) &amp;= 1 \\end{align}$$ <p>which, using that $bc-ad=1$, can be easily shown to be true.</p> <p>From this we see that the property is always maintained and thus all fractions are irreducible.</p> <p>The presence of all fractions. This proof is closely related to locating a fraction in the Stern-Brocot tree. From the ordering property we have that left subtree of a fraction contains only fractions smaller than the parent fraction, and the right subtree contains only fractions larger than the parent fraction. This means we can search for a fraction by traversing the tree from the root, going left if the target is smaller than the fraction and going right if the target is larger.</p> <p>Pick an arbitrary positive target fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$. It is obviously between $\\frac{0}{1}$ and $\\frac{1}{0}$, so the only way for the fraction to not be in the tree is if it takes an infinite number of steps to get to it.</p> <p>If that is the case we would at all iterations have</p> $$     \\frac{a}{b} \\lt \\frac{x}{y} \\lt \\frac{c}{d} $$ <p>which (using the fact than an integer $z \\gt 0 \\iff z \\ge 1$) can be rewritten as</p> $$ \\begin{align}     bx - ay &amp;\\ge 1 \\\\     cy - dx &amp;\\ge 1. \\end{align} $$ <p>Now multiply the first inequality by $c+d$ and the second with $a+b$ and add them to get</p> $$     (c+d)(bx - ay) + (a+b)(cy - dx) \\ge a+b+c+d. $$ <p>Expanding this and using the previously shown property $bc-ad=1$ we get that</p> $$     x+y \\ge a+b+c+d. $$ <p>And given that at every iteration at least one of $a,b,c,d$ will increase, the fraction searching process will contain no more than $x+y$ iterations.

Now let's look at it from a different side. If we look at any vertex, the string that corresponds to it is a prefix of one or more strings in the set, thus each vertex of the trie can be interpreted as a position in one or more strings from the set.</p> <p>In fact, the trie vertices can be interpreted as states in a finite deterministic automaton. From any state we can transition - using some input letter - to other states, i.e., to another position in the set of strings. For example, if there is only one string $abc$ in the dictionary, and we are standing at vertex $ab$, then using the letter $c$ we can go to the vertex $abc$.</p> <p>Thus we can understand the edges of the trie as transitions in an automaton according to the corresponding letter. However, in an automaton we need to have transitions for each combination of a state and a letter. If we try to perform a transition using a letter, and there is no corresponding edge in the trie, then we nevertheless must go into some state.</p> <p>More precisely, suppose we are in a state corresponding to a string $t$, and we want to transition to a different state using the character $c$. If there is an edge labeled with this letter $c$, then we can simply go over this edge, and get the vertex corresponding to $t + c$. If there is no such edge, since we want to maintain the invariant that the current state is the longest partial match in the processed string, we must find the longest string in the trie that's a proper suffix of the string $t$, and try to perform a transition from there.</p> <p>For example, let the trie be constructed by the strings $ab$ and $bc$, and we are currently at the vertex corresponding to $ab$, which is also an $\\text{output}$ vertex.

The only special case is the root of the trie, whose suffix link will point to itself. Now we can reformulate the statement about the transitions in the automaton like this: while there is no transition from the current vertex of the trie using the current letter (or until we reach the root), we follow the suffix link.</p> <p>Thus we reduced the problem of constructing an automaton to the problem of finding suffix links for all vertices of the trie. However, we will build these suffix links, oddly enough, using the transitions constructed in the automaton.</p> <p>The suffix links of the root vertex and all its immediate children point to the root vertex. For any vertex $v$ deeper in the tree, we can calculate the suffix link as follows: if $p$ is the ancestor of $v$ with $c$ being the letter labeling the edge from $p$ to $v$, go to $p$, then follow its suffix link, and perform the transition with the letter $c$ from there.</p> <p>Thus, the problem of finding the transitions has been reduced to the problem of finding suffix links, and the problem of finding suffix links has been reduced to the problem of finding a suffix link and a transition, except for vertices closer to the root.

We may assume that when we're in a vertex $v$, its suffix link $u = link[v]$ is already successfully computed, and for all vertices with shorter length transitions from them are also fully computed.</p> <p>Assume that at the moment we stand in a vertex $v$ and consider a character $c$. We essentially have two cases:</p> <ol> <li>$go[v][c] = -1$. In this case, we may assign $go[v][c] = go[u][c]$, which is already known by the induction hypothesis;</li> <li>$go[v][c] = w \\neq -1$. In this case, we may assign $link[w] = go[u][c]$.</li> </ol> <p>In this way, we spend $O(1)$ time per each pair of a vertex and a character, making the running time $O(mk)$. The major overhead here is that we copy a lot of transitions from $u$ in the first case, while the transitions of the second case form the trie and sum up to $m$ over all vertices. To avoid the copying of $go[u][c]$, we may use a persistent array data structure, using which we initially copy $go[u]$ into $go[v]$ and then only update values for characters in which the transition would differ.

We will now process the text letter by letter using the automaton, starting at the root of the trie.

First, it is clear that if we stand on a $\\text{output}$ vertex, then the string corresponding to the vertex ends at this position in the text. However this is by no means the only possible case of achieving a match: if we can reach one or more  $\\text{output}$ vertices by moving along the suffix links, then there will be also a match corresponding to each found $\\text{output}$ vertex. A simple example demonstrating this situation can be created using the set of strings $\\{dabce, abc, bc\\}$ and the text $dabc$.</p> <p>Thus if we store in each $\\text{output}$ vertex the index of the string corresponding to it (or the list of indices if duplicate strings appear in the set), then we can find in $O(n)$ time the indices of all strings which match the current state, by simply following the suffix links from the current vertex to the root. This is not the most efficient solution, since this results in $O(n ~ \\text{len})$ complexity overall. However, this can be optimized by computing and storing the nearest $\\text{output}$ vertex that is reachable using suffix links (this is sometimes called the exit link). This value we can compute lazily in linear time. Thus for each vertex we can advance in $O(1)$ time to the next marked vertex in the suffix link path, i.e. to the next match. Thus for each match we spend $O(1)$ time, and therefore we reach the complexity $O(\\text{len} + \\text{ans})$.</p> <p>If you only want to count the occurrences and not find the indices themselves, you can calculate the number of marked vertices in the suffix link path for each vertex $v$.

To calculate the value for some $i$ we remember that the string $g_i$ consists of $g_{i-1}$, the $i$ character of the alphabet, and $g_{i-1}$. Thus the automaton will go into the state:</p> $$\\text{mid} = \\text{aut}[G[i-1][j]][i]$$ $$G[i][j] = G[i-1][\\text{mid}]$$ <p>The values for $K[i][j]$ can also be easily counted.</p> $$K[i][j] = K[i-1][j] + (\\text{mid} == |s|) + K[i-1][\\text{mid}]$$ <p>So we can solve the problem for Gray strings, and similarly also a huge number of other similar problems. For example the exact same method also solves the following problem: we are given a string $s$ and some patterns $t_i$, each of which is specified as follows: it is a string of ordinary characters, and there might be some recursive insertions of the previous strings of the form $t_k^{\\text{cnt}}$, which means that at this place we have to insert the string $t_k$ $\\text{cnt}$ times.

We want to do better. The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings. Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.</p> <p>For the conversion, we need a so-called hash function. The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called hash of the string. The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then their hashes also have to be equal ($\\text{hash}(s) = \\text{hash}(t)$). Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.</p> <p>Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold. If the hashes are equal ($\\text{hash}(s) = \\text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal. E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$. Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function. The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings. If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them. And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.</p> <p>So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.

This will only give us an algorithm for constructing a suffix array in $O(n \\log^2 n)$ times.</p> <p>How do we quickly perform such a sorting of the pairs? Since the elements of the pairs do not exceed $n$, we can use counting sort again. However sorting pairs with counting sort is not the most efficient. To achieve a better hidden constant in the complexity, we will use another trick.</p> <p>We use here the technique on which radix sort is based: to sort the pairs we first sort them by the second element, and then by the first element (with a stable sort, i.e. sorting without breaking the relative order of equal elements). However the second elements were already sorted in the previous iteration. Thus, in order to sort the pairs by the second elements, we just need to subtract $2^{k-1}$ from the indices in $p[]$ (e.g. if the smallest substring of length $2^{k-1}$ starts at position $i$, then the substring of length $2^k$ with the smallest second half starts at $i - 2^{k-1}$).</p> <p>So only by simple subtractions we can sort the second elements of the pairs in $p[]$. Now we need to perform a stable sort by the first elements. As already mentioned, this can be accomplished with counting sort.</p> <p>The only thing left is to compute the equivalence classes $c[]$, but as before this can be done by simply iterating over the sorted permutation $p[]$ and comparing neighboring pairs.</p> <p>Here is the remaining implementation.

This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.</p> <p>Here is an example of a similar scenario:</p> $$ s = \"aaaabaa\" $$ <p>When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.</p> <p>Thus, as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can safely take:</p> $$ z_0[i] = \\min(r - i,\\; z[i-l]) $$ <p>After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the trivial algorithm -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in the initial value of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of the trivial algorithm, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.</p> <p>The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time.
