# Minimum Window Substring

The **Minimum Window Substring** is a classic **sliding window** problem that asks you to find the smallest substring in `s` containing all the characters of string `t` (including duplicates).  

This problem tests one‚Äôs ability to maintain dynamic character counts while expanding and contracting a window efficiently ‚Äî an essential pattern in substring and subarray problems.

---

## üß© Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the **minimum window substring** of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window.  
If there is **no such substring**, return the empty string `""`.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

---

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included, but s has only one 'a'.
```


---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

---

## üöÄ Approach

The goal is to maintain a **window** over string `s` that always contains all characters of `t` ‚Äî and shrink it whenever possible to find the smallest such window.

### Key Steps:
1. **Store frequency of characters** in `t` using a hash map.  
2. Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window in `s`.  
3. Expand the `right` pointer to include new characters until all characters in `t` are covered.  
4. Once valid, **move the `left` pointer** to shrink the window while maintaining validity.  
5. Keep track of the smallest valid window seen so far.

---

## üß† Algorithm

1. Initialize:
   - A frequency map `freqT` for characters in `t`.
   - A frequency map `window` for current characters in `s`.
   - Counters for how many characters are satisfied.
2. Move `right` pointer across `s`:
   - Include the current character in `window`.
   - If it matches the desired count in `t`, increment the `formed` counter.
3. When `formed == required` (all characters satisfied):
   - Try to shrink the window from the left.
   - Update the answer when a smaller valid window is found.
4. Continue until the end of `s`.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m + n)`  
  Each character in `s` is visited at most twice ‚Äî once when expanding and once when contracting the window.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(k)`  
  Where `k` is the number of distinct characters in `t`.

        unordered_map<char, int> freqT, window;
        for (char c : t) freqT[c]++;

        int have = 0, need = freqT.size();
        int resLen = INT_MAX;
        int resL = 0, resR = 0;

        int l = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r < s.size(); r++) {
            char c = s[r];
            window[c]++;
            
            // If the current character added equals the desired count in t
            if (freqT.count(c) && window[c] == freqT[c])
                have++;

            // Try to contract the window from left until it ceases to be 'desirable'
            while (have == need) {
                // Update our result if this window is smaller
                if ((r - l + 1) < resLen) {
                    resL = l;
                    resR = r;
                    resLen = r - l + 1;
                }
                
                // The character at position l is no longer part of the window
                window[s[l]]--;
                if (freqT.count(s[l]) && window[s[l]] < freqT[s[l]])
                    have--;
                l++;
            }
        }
        
        return resLen == INT_MAX ? "" : s.substr(resL, resLen);

## üéØ Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the algorithm with `s = "ADOBECODEBANC"` and `t = "ABC"`:

### Initial Setup:
- `freqT = {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1}`
- `need = 3` (unique characters in t)
- `have = 0` (characters satisfied)
- `window = {}` (current window character counts)

### Iteration Steps:

| Step | r | s[r] | window | have | Valid? | Action |
|------|---|------|--------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 0 | A | {A:1} | 1 | No | Expand |
| 2 | 1 | D | {A:1, D:1} | 1 | No | Expand |
| 3 | 2 | O | {A:1, D:1, O:1} | 1 | No | Expand |
| 4 | 3 | B | {A:1, D:1, O:1, B:1} | 2 | No | Expand |
| 5 | 4 | E | {A:1, D:1, O:1, B:1, E:1} | 2 | No | Expand |
| 6 | 5 | C | {A:1, D:1, O:1, B:1, E:1, C:1} | 3 | **Yes** | Contract |

When valid window found at step 6:
- Current window: "ADOBEC" (length 6)
- Start contracting from left...
- Continue until we find minimum window "BANC" (length 4)

2. **Character Frequency**: Use hash maps to efficiently track character counts
