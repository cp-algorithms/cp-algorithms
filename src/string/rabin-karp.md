# Rabin-Karp Algorithm for string matching

This algorithm is based on the concept of hashing, so if you are not familiar with string hashing, refer to the [string hashing](./string/string-hashing.html) article.
 
This algorithm was authored by Rabin and Karp in 1987.

Problem: Given two strings - a pattern $s$ and a text $t$, determine if the pattern appears in the text and if it does, enumerate all its occurrences in $O(|s| + |t|)$ time.

Algorithm: Calculate the hash for the pattern $s$.
Calculate hash values for all the prefixes of the text $t$.
Now, we can compare a substring of length $|s|$ with $s$ in constant time using the calculated hashes.
So, compare each substring of length $|s|$ with the pattern. This will take a total of $O(|t|)$ time.
Hence the final complexity of the algorithm is $O(|t| + |s|)$: $O(|s|)$ is required for calculating the hash of the pattern and $O(|t|)$ for comparing each substring of length $|s|$ with the pattern.

## Implementation
```cpp rabin_karp
vector<int> rabin_karp(string const& s, string const& t) {
    const int p = 31; 
    const int m = 1e9 + 9;
    int S = s.size(), T = t.size();

    vector<long long> p_pow(max(S, T)); 
    p_pow[0] = 1; 
    for (int i = 1; i < (int)p_pow.size(); i++) 
        p_pow[i] = (p_pow[i-1] * p) % m;

    vector<long long> h(T + 1, 0); 
    for (int i = 0; i < T; i++)
        h[i+1] = (h[i] + (t[i] - 'a' + 1) * p_pow[i]) % m; 
    long long h_s = 0; 
    for (int i = 0; i < S; i++) 
        h_s = (h_s + (s[i] - 'a' + 1) * p_pow[i]) % m; 

    vector<int> occurences;
    for (int i = 0; i + S - 1 < T; i++) { 
        long long cur_h = (h[i+S] + m - h[i]) % m; 
        if (cur_h == h_s * p_pow[i] % m)
            occurences.push_back(i);
    }
    return occurences;
}
```
