#Suffix Array

###What is suffix?

Let $S$ be a string of length $N$. $i^{th}$ suffix of $S$ is substring $S[i \ldots n - 1], i = 0 \ldots n - 1$.

###What is suffix array?

As a data structure, it is widely used in areas such as data compression, bioinformatics and, 
in general, in any area that deals with strings and string matching problems, so, as you can see, 
it is of great importance to know efficient algorithms to construct a suffix array for a given string.

A **Suffix Array** will contain integers that represent the **starting indexes** of the all the suffixes of a given string, after the aforementioned suffixes are sorted.

###Example
Let $S\ =\ abaab$  
All suffixes are as follows  
$0.\ abaab$  
$1.\ baab$  
$2.\ aab$  
$3.\ ab$  
$4.\ b$  

After sorting these strings:  
$2.\ aab$  
$3.\ ab$  
$0.\ abaab$  
$4.\ b$  
$1.\ baaab$  

Suffix Array for $S$ will be $(2,\ 3,\ 0,\ 4,\ 1)$.  

###Construction Of Suffix Array

####$O(N^2\log{N})$ Approach

This is most naive approach. Get all the suffixes and sort them using Quicksort or Mergesort simultanously retaining there
original indexes. Sorting takes $O(N\log{N})$ so how it is $O(N^2\log{N})$??.
What we miss here is comparison of two strings is not $O(1)$ in worst case it takes $O(N)$.
So the final complexity is $O(N^2\log{N})$. We can reduce this comparison from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Read further :).


####$O(N\log^2{N})$ Approach

We can reduce comparison of two strings from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ using the fact that, given strings are not
random strings they are part of single string. **Each string has something common with other.**  

Lets see how we can use this fact.
Lets sort the suffixes on basis of there first character and assign them rank.  
If two are equal rank for them will be same.  
  
$0.\ a|baab$  
$0.\ a|ab$  
$0.\ a|b$  
$1.\ b|aab$  
$1.\ b|$  

**Note:** '|' denotes sorting is based on left part of '|'.  

Now double the characters to take from each for sorting i.e. 2.  
When we take string of two chars we can have two parts first containing 1 char other containing 1.  
Lets compare $abaab$ with $baab$, based on the first part, that of 1 character we can say that $abaab$ will  
be always ranked above $baab$ so skip further comparison.  

Now compare $abaab$ with $aab$ based on first part both have same rank. Now we will compare there second half part,  
second half part of $abaab$ is only $b$ and for $aab$ be is $a$ for these we already know there ranks  
for $b$ (i.e. whole $baab$) is 1 and $a$ (i.e. whole $ab$) is 0.  
Hence $abaab$ will be ranked above $baab$.  

For the strings not having second part we will rank there second part highest i.e. -1
for example $b$ is not having $2^{nd}$ char so its rank tuple will be (1, -1).  

$0.\ aa|b$  
$1.\ ab|aab$  
$1.\ ab|$  
$2.\ b|$  
$2.\ ba|ab$

Now, in the next iteration, we sort 4-charaters strings. This involves a lot of comparisons between different 4-charaters strings.  
How do we compare two 4-charaters strings? Well, we could compare them character by character. That would be up to 4 operations per comparison.  
But instead, we compare them by looking up the ranks of the two charaters contained in them, using the rank table generated in the previous steps.  
That rank represents the lexicographic rank from the previous 2-charater sort, so if any given 4-character string has a higher rank than another 4-character string, then it must be lexicographically greater somewhere in the first two characters.  
Hence, if for two 4-charaters string the rank is identical, they must be identical in the first two characters.  
In other words, two look-ups in the rank table are sufficient to compare all 4 characters of the two 4-charaters strings.  

Similarly we can compare 8, 16, 32 $\ldots$ strings in atmost two integer comparisons.  
i.e. $O(1)$ comparison.  

Following fully commented code will clarify more.

// suffixRank is table hold the rank of each string on each iteration  
// suffixRank[i][j] denotes rank of jth suffix at ith iteration

    // 'stp' keeps the track of number of iteration
    // 'cnt' store length of suffix which is going to be compared

    // On each iteration we initialize tuple for each suffix array
    // with values computed from previous iteration

    for(int cnt = 1, stp = 1; cnt < N; cnt *= 2, ++stp) {

            // else rank for ith will be currRank ( i.e. rank of (i - 1)th ) plus 1, i.e ( currRank + 1 )

            if(L[i - 1].firstHalf != L[i].firstHalf || L[i - 1].secondHalf != L[i].secondHalf)

        }

    }
