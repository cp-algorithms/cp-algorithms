# Check if point belongs to the convex polygon in $O(\log N)$

Consider the following problem: you are given a convex polygon with integer vertices and a lot of queries.
Each query is a point, for which we should determine whether it lies inside or on the boundary of the polygon or not.
Suppose the polygon is ordered counter-clockwise. We will answer each query in $O(\log n)$ online.

## Algorithm
Let's pick the point with the smallest x-coordinate. If there are several of them, we pick the one with the smallest y-coordinate. Let's denote it as $p_0$.
Now all other points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ of the polygon are ordered by their polar angle from the chosen point (because the polygon is ordered counter-clockwise).

If the point belongs to the polygon, it belongs to some triangle $p_0, p_i, p_{i + 1}$ (maybe more than one if it lies on the boundary of triangles).
Consider the triangle $p_0, p_i, p_{i + 1}$ such that $p$ belongs to this triangle and $i$ is maximum among all such triangles.

There is one special case. $p$ lies on the segment $(p_0, p_n)$. This case we will check separately.
Otherwise all points $p_j$ with $j \le i$ are counter-clockwise from $p$ with respect to $p_0$, and all other points are not counter-clockwise from $p$.
This means that me can apply binary to search for the point $p_i$, such that $p_i$ is not counter-clockwise from $p$ with respect to $p_0$, and $i$ is maximum among all such points.
And afterwards we check if the points is actually in the determined triangle.

The sign of $(a - c) \times (b - c)$ will tell us, if the point $a$ is clockwise or counter-clockwise from the point $b$ with respect to the point $c$.
If $(a - c) \times (b - c) > 0$, then the point $a$ is to the right of the vector going from $c$ to $b$, which means clockwise from $b$ with respect to $c$.
And if $(a - c) \times (b - c) < 0$, then the point is to the left, or counter clockwise.
And it is exactly on the line between the points $b$ and $c$.

Back to the algorithm:
Consider a query point $p$.
Firstly, we must check if the point lies between $p_1$ and $p_n$.
Otherwise we already know that it cannot be part of the polygon.
This can be done by checking if the cross product $(p_1 - p_0)\times(p - p_0)$ is zero or has the same sign with $(p_1 - p_0)\times(p_n - p_0)$, and $(p_n - p_0)\times(p - p_0)$ is zero or has the same sign with $(p_n - p_0)\times(p_1 - p_0)$.
Then we handle the special case in which $p$ is part of the line $(p_0, p_1)$.
And then we can binary search the last point from $p_1,\dots p_n$ which is not counter-clockwise from $p$ with respect to $p_0$.
For a single point $p_i$ this condition can be checked by checking that $(p_i - p_0)\times(p - p_0) \le 0$. After we found such a point $p_i$, we must test if $p$ lies inside the triangle $p_0, p_i, p_{i + 1}$.
To test if it belongs to the triangle, we may simply check that $|(p_i - p_0)\times(p_{i + 1} - p_0)| = |(p_0 - p)\times(p_i - p)| + |(p_i - p)\times(p_{i + 1} - p)| + |(p_{i + 1} - p)\times(p_0 - p)|$.
This checks if the area of the triangle $p_0, p_i, p_{i+1}$ has to exact same size as the sum of the sizes of the triangle $p_0, p_i, p$, the triangle $p_0, p, p_{i+1}$ and the triangle $p_i, p_{i+1}, p$.
If $p$ is outside, then the sum of those three triangle will be bigger than the size of the triangle.
If it is inside, then it will be equal.

## Implementation

The function `prepair` will make sure that the lexicographical smallest point (smallest x value, and in ties smallest y value) will be $p_0$, and computes the vectors $p_i - p_0$.
Afterwards the function `pointInConvexPolygon` computes the result of a query.

```cpp points_in_convex_polygon
struct pt{
	long long x, y;
	pt(){}
	pt(long long _x, long long _y):x(_x), y(_y){}
	pt operator+(const pt & p) const { return pt(x + p.x, y + p.y); }
	pt operator-(const pt & p) const { return pt(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
	long long cross(const pt & p) const { return x * p.y - y * p.x; }

	long long dot(const pt & a, const pt & b) const { return (a - *this).dot(b - *this); }
	long long sqrLen() const { return this->dot(*this); }
};

bool lexComp(const pt & l, const pt & r){
	return l.x < r.x || (l.x == r.x && l.y < r.y);
}

	return val > 0 ? 1 : (val == 0 ? 0 : -1);
}

int n;

bool pointInTriangle(pt a, pt b, pt c, pt point){
	long long s1 = abs(a.cross(b, c));
	long long s2 = abs(point.cross(a, b)) + abs(point.cross(b, c)) + abs(point.cross(c, a));
	return s1 == s2;
}

	n = points.size();
	int pos = 0;
	for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
		if(lexComp(points[i], points[pos]))
			pos = i;
	}
	rotate(points.begin(), points.begin() + pos, points.end());

    n--;
    seq.resize(n);
	for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        seq[i] = points[i + 1] - points[0];
}

bool pointInConvexPolygon(pt point){
	if(seq[0].cross(point) != 0 && sgn(seq[0].cross(point)) != sgn(seq[0].cross(seq[n - 1])))

		return false;

	if(seq[0].cross(point) == 0)
		return seq[0].sqrLen() >= point.sqrLen();

		else r = mid;
	}
	int pos = l;
