# Minimum Enclosing Circle

Consider the following problem:

!!! example "[Library Checker - Minimum Enclosing Circle](https://judge.yosupo.jp/problem/minimum_enclosing_circle)"

    You're given $n \leq 10^5$ points $p_i=(x_i, y_i)$.

    For each $p_i$, find whether it lies on the circumference of the minimum enclosing circle of $\{p_1,\dots,p_n\}$.

Here, by the minimum enclosing circle (MEC) we mean a circle with minimum possible radius that contains all the $n$ points, inside the circle or on its boundary. This problem has a simple randomized solution that, on first glance, looks like it would run in $O(n^3)$, but actually works in $O(n)$ expected time.

To better understand the reasoning below, we should immediately note that the solution to the problem is unique:

??? question "Why is the MEC unique?"

    Consider the following setup: Let $r$ be the radius of the MEC. We draw a circle of radius $r$ around each of the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$. Geometrically, the centers of circles that have radius $r$ and cover all the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ form the intersection of all $n$ circles.

    Now, if the intersection is just a single point, this already proves that it is unique. Otherwise, the intersection is a shape of non-zero area, so we can reduce $r$ by a tiny bit, and still have non-empty intersection, which contradicts the assumption that $r$ was the minimum possible radius of the enclosing circle.

    With a similar logic, we can also show the uniqueness of the MEC if we additionally demand that it passes through a given specific point $p_i$ or two points $p_i$ and $p_j$ (it is also unique because its radius uniquely defines it).

    Alternatively, we can also assume that there are two MECs, and then notice that their intersection (which contains the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ already) must have a smaller diameter than initial circles, and thus can be covered with a smaller circle.

## Welzl's algorithm

For brevity, let's denote $\operatorname{mec}(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ to be the MEC of $\{p_1,\dots,p_n\}$, and let $P_i = \{p_1,\dots,p_i\}$.

The algorithm, initially [proposed](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0038202) by Welzl in 1991, goes as follows:

1. Apply a random permutation to the input sequence of points.
2. Maintain the current candidate to be the MEC $C$, starting with $C = \operatorname{mec}(p_1, p_2)$.
3. Iterate over $i=3..n$ and check if $p_i \in C$.
    1. If $p_i \in C$ it means that $C$ is the MEC of $P_i$.
    2. Otherwise, assign $C = \operatorname{mec}(p_i, p_1)$ and iterate over $j=2..i$ and check if $p_j \in C$.
        1. If $p_j \in C$, then $C$ is the MEC of $P_j$ among circles that pass through $p_i$.
        2. Otherwise, assign $C=\operatorname{mec}(p_i, p_j)$ and iterate over $k=1..j$ and check if $p_k \in C$.
            1. If $p_k \in C$, then $C$ is the MEC of $P_k$ among circles that pass through $p_i$ and $p_j$.
            2. Otherwise, $C=\operatorname{mec}(p_i,p_j,p_k)$ is the MEC of $P_k$ among circles that pass through $p_i$ and $p_j$.

We can see that each level of nestedness here has an invariant to maintain (that $C$ is the MEC among circles that also pass through additionally given $0$, $1$ or $2$ points), and whenever the inner loop closes, its invariant becomes equivalent to the invariant of the current iteration of its parent loop. This, in turn, ensures the _correctness_ of the algorithm as a whole.

Omitting some technical details, for now, the whole algorithm can be implemented in C++ as follows:

```cpp
struct point {...};

// Is represented by 2 or 3 points on its circumference
struct mec {...};

bool inside(mec const& C, point p) {
    return ...;
}

// Choose some good generator of randomness for the shuffle
mt19937_64 gen(...);
mec enclosing_circle(vector<point> &p) {
    ranges::shuffle(p, gen);
    auto C = mec{p[0], p[1]};
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(!inside(C, p[i])) {
            C = mec{p[i], p[0]};
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if(!inside(C, p[j])) {
                    C = mec{p[i], p[j]};
                    for(int k = 0; k < j; k++) {
                        if(!inside(C, p[k])) {
                            C = mec{p[i], p[j], p[k]};
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return C;
}
```

Now, it is to be expected that checking that a point $p_i$ is inside the MEC of $2$ or $3$ points can be done in $O(1)$ (we will discuss this later on). But even then, the algorithm above looks as if it would take $O(n^3)$ in the worst case just because of all the nested loops. So, how come we claimed the linear expected runtime? Let's figure out!

### Complexity analysis

For the inner-most loop (over $k$), clearly its expected runtime is $O(j)$ operations. What about the loop over $j$?

It only triggers the next loop if $p_j$ is on the boundary of the MEC of $P_j$ that also passes through point $i$, _and removing $p_j$ would further shrink the circle_. Of all points in $P_j$ there can only be at most $2$ points with such property, because if there are more than $2$ points from $P_j$ on the boundary, it means that after removing any of them, there will still be at least $3$ points on the boundary, sufficient to uniquely define the circle.

In other words, after initial random shuffle, there is at most $\frac{2}{j}$ probability that we get one of the at most two unlucky points as $p_j$. Summing it up over all $j$ from $1$ to $i$, we get the expected runtime of

$$
\sum\limits_{j=1}^i \frac{2}{j} \cdot O(j) = O(i).
$$

In exactly same fashion we can now also prove that the outermost loop has expected runtime of $O(n)$.

### Checking that a point is in the MEC of 2 or 3 points

Let's now figure out the implementation detail of `point` and `mec`. In this problem, it turns out to be particularly useful to use [std::complex](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/22175) as a class for points:

```cpp
using ftype = int64_t;
using point = complex<ftype>;
```

As a reminder, a complex number is a number of type $x+yi$, where $i^2=-1$ and $x, y \in \mathbb R$. In C++, such complex number is represented by a 2-dimensional point $(x, y)$. Complex numbers already implement basic component-wise linear operations (addition, multiplication by a real number), but also their multiplication and division carry certain geometric meaning.

Without going in too much detail, we will note the most important property for this particular task: Multiplying two complex numbers adds up their polar angles (counted from $Ox$ counter-clockwise), and taking a conjugate (i.e. changing $z=x+yi$ into $\overline{z} = x-yi$) multiplies the polar angle with $-1$. This allows us to formulate some very simple criteria for whether a point $z$ is inside the MEC of $2$ or $3$ specific points.

#### MEC of 2 points

For $2$ points $a$ and $b$, their MEC is simply the circle centered at $\frac{a+b}{2}$ with the radius $\frac{|a-b|}{2}$, in other words the circle that has $ab$ as a diameter. To check if $z$ is inside this circle we simply need to check that the angle between $za$ and $zb$ is not acute.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Diameter_angles.svg">
<br>
<i>Inner angles are obtuse, external angles are acute and angles on the circumference are right</i>
</center>

Equivalently, we need to check that

$$
I_0=(b-z)\overline{(a-z)}
$$

doesn't have a positive real coordinate (corresponding to points that have a polar angle between $-90^\circ$ and $90^\circ$).

#### MEC of 3 points

Adding $z$ to the triangle $abc$ will make it a quadrilateral. Consider the following expression:

$$
\angle azb + \angle bca
$$

In a [cyclic quadrilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral), if $c$ and $z$ are from the same side of $ab$, then the angles are equal, and will ad up to $0^\circ$ when summed up signed (i.e. positive if counter-clockwise and negative if clockwise). Correspondingly, if $c$ and $z$ are on the opposite sides, the angles will add up to $180^\circ$.

<center>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Opposing_inscribed_angles.svg">
<br>
<i>Adjacent inscribed angles are same, opposing angles complement to 180 degrees</i>
</center>

In terms of complex numbers, we can note that $\angle azb$ is the polar angle of $(b-z)\overline{(a-z)}$ and $\angle bca$ is the polar angle of $(a-c)\overline{(b-c)}$. Thus, we can conclude that $\angle azb + \angle bca$ is the polar angle of

$$
I_1 = (b-z) \overline{(a-z)} (a-c) \overline{(b-c)}
$$

If the angle is $0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$, it means that the imaginary part of $I_1$ is $0$, otherwise we can deduce whether $z$ is inside or outside of the enclosing circle of $abc$ by checking the sign of the imaginary part of $I_1$. Positive imaginary part corresponds to positive angles, and negative imaginary part corresponds to negative angles.

But which one of them means that $z$ is inside or outside of the circle? As we already noticed, having $z$ inside the circle generally increases the magnitude of $\angle azb$, while having it outside the circle decreases it. As such, we have the following 4 cases:

1. $\angle bca > 0^\circ$, $c$ on the same side of $ab$ as $z$. Then, $\angle azb < 0^\circ$, and $\angle azb + \angle bca < 0^\circ$ for points inside the circle.
3. $\angle bca < 0^\circ$, $c$ on the same side of $ab$ as $z$. Then, $\angle azb > 0^\circ$, and $\angle azb + \angle bca > 0^\circ$ for points inside the circle.
2. $\angle bca > 0^\circ$, $c$ on the opposite side of $ab$ to $z$. Then, $\angle azb > 0^\circ$ and $\angle azb + \angle bca > 180^\circ$ for points inside the circle.
4. $\angle bca < 0^\circ$, $c$ on the opposite side of $ab$ to $z$. Then, $\angle azb < 0^\circ$ and $\angle azb + \angle bca < 180^\circ$ for points inside the circle.

In other words, if $\angle bca$ is positive, points inside the circle will have $\angle azb + \angle bca < 0^\circ$, otherwise they will have $\angle azb + \angle bca > 0^\circ$, assuming that we normalize the angles between $-180^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. This, in turn, can be checked by the signs of imaginary parts of $I_2=(a-c)\overline{(b-c)}$ and $I_1 = I_0 I_2$.

**Note**: As we multiply four complex numbers to get $I_1$, the intermediate coefficients can be as large as $O(A^4)$, where $A$ is the largest coordinate magnitude in the input. On the bright side, if the input is integer, both checks above can be done fully in integers.

#### Implementation

Now, to actually implement the check, we should first decide how to represent the MEC. As our criteria work with the points directly, a natural and efficient way to do this is to say that MEC is directly represented as a pair or triple of points that defines it:

```cpp
using mec = variant<
    array<point, 2>,
    array<point, 3>
>;
```

Now, we can use `std::visit` to efficiently deal with both cases in accordance with criteria above:

```cpp
/* I < 0 if z inside C,
   I > 0 if z outside C,
   I = 0 if z on the circumference of C */
ftype indicator(mec const& C, point z) {
    return visit([&](auto &&C) {
        point a = C[0], b = C[1];
        point I0 = (b - z) * conj(a - z);
        if constexpr (size(C) == 2) {
            return real(I0);
        } else {
            point c = C[2];
            point I2 = (a - c) * conj(b - c);
            point I1 = I0 * I2;
            return imag(I2) < 0 ? -imag(I1) : imag(I1);
        }
    }, C);
}

bool inside(mec const& C, point p) {
    return indicator(C, p) <= 0;
}

```

Now, we can finally ensure that everything works by submitting the problem to the Library Checker: [#308668](https://judge.yosupo.jp/submission/308668).
