The goal of this project is to translate the wonderful resource
[http://e-maxx.ru/algo](http://e-maxx.ru/algo) which provides descriptions of many algorithms
and data structures especially popular in field of competitive programming.
Moreover we want to improve the collected knowledge by extending the articles
and adding new articles to the collection.

Compiled pages are published at [https://cp-algorithms.com/](https://cp-algorithms.com/).

## Changelog

- June 5, 2022: Enabled content tabs and sidebar navigation. The navigation is moved to a [separate page](navigation.md) and its structure should be adjusted in [navigation.md](https://github.com/e-maxx-eng/e-maxx-eng/blob/master/src/navigation.md) whenever a new article is created or an old one is moved.
- January 16, 2022: Switched to the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site generator with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, which give the website a more modern look, brings a couple of new features (dark mode, better search, ...), makes the website more stable (in terms of rendering math formulas), and makes it easier to contribute.

### New articles

- (12 May 2022) [Factoring Exponentiation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/factoring-exp.html)
- (7 May 2022) [Knuth's Optimization](https://cp-algorithms.com/dynamic_programming/knuth-optimization.html)
- (31 March 2022) [Continued fractions](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/continued-fractions.html)
