# Minimum spanning tree - Kruskal with Disjoint Set Union

For an explanation of the MST problem and the Kruskal algorithm, first see the [main article on Kruskal's algorithm](./graph/mst_kruskal.html).

In this article we will consider the data structure ["Disjoint Set Union"](./data_structures/disjoint_set_union.html) for implementing Kruskal's algorithm, which will allow the algorithm to achieve the time complexity of $O(M \log N)$.

## Description

Just as in the simple version of the Kruskal algorithm, we sort all the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of weights.
Then put each vertex in its own tree (i.e. its set) via calls to the `make_set` function - it will take a total of $O(N)$.
We iterate through all the edges (in sorted order) and for each edge determine whether the ends belong to different trees (with two `find_set` calls in $O(1)$ each).
Finally, we need to perform the union of the two trees (sets), for which the DSU `union_sets` function will be called - also in $O(1)$.
So we get the total time complexity of $O(M \log N + N + M)$ = $O(M \log N)$.

## Implementation

Here is an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm with Union by Rank.

```cpp
vector<int> parent, rank;

void make_set(int v) {
    parent[v] = v;
    rank[v] = 0;
}

int find_set(int v) {
    if (v == parent[v])
        return v;
    return parent[v] = find_set(parent[v]);
}

void union_sets(int a, int b) {
    a = find_set(a);
    b = find_set(b);
    if (a != b) {
        if (rank[a] < rank[b])
            swap(a, b);
        parent[b] = a;
        if (rank[a] == rank[b])
            rank[a]++;
    }
}

struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(Edge const& other) {
        return weight < other.weight;
    }
};

int n;
vector<Edge> edges;

int cost = 0;
vector<Edge> result;
parent.resize(n);
rank.resize(n);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    make_set(i);

sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());

for (Edge e : edges) {
    if (find_set(e.u) != find_set(e.v)) {
        cost += e.weight;
        result.push_back(e);
        union_sets(e.u, e.v);
    }
}
```

Notice: since the MST will contain exactly $N-1$ edges, we can stop the for loop once we found that many.
