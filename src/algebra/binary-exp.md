#Binary Exponentiation

Raising `a` to the power of `b` is expressed naively as multiplication of `a` taken `b` times:
$a^{b} = a \cdot a \cdot \ldots \cdot a$.

However this approach is not practical for large `a` or `b`. **Binary exponentiation** is a
simple trick. We know from school that:

$$a^{b+c} = a^{b} \cdot a^{c} \qquad and \qquad a^{2b} = a^{b} \cdot a^{b} = (a^{b})^{2}$$

Let us then write `b` in binary system, for example:

$$3^{11} = 3^{1011_{2}} = 3^{8} \cdot 3^{2} \cdot 3^{1}$$

So we need only find sequence of squared numbers:

$3^{1} = 3$  
$3^{2} = (3^{1})^{2} = 3 \cdot 3 = 9$  
$3^{4} = (3^{2})^{2} = 9 \cdot 9 = 81$  
$3^{8} = (3^{4})^{2} = 81 \cdot 81 = 6561$

And multiply three of them (skipping $3^{4}$ because corresponding bit in `b` is zero):
$\quad 3^{11} = 6561 \cdot 9 \cdot 3 = 177147$

This approach has important applications in many tasks not related to arithmetics, since it
can be used with any operations having the property of **associativity**:

$$(X \cdot Y) \cdot Z = X \cdot (Y \cdot Z)$$

Most obviously this applies to modular multiplication, then to multiplication of matrices and
to other problems which we will discuss below. As another example - in Ancient Egypt the
same approach was used for simple multiplication (by summing up members of the sequence
`a`, `2a`, `4a`, `8a` according to binary representation of multiplier `b`) -
and it is still used inside CPUs of contemporary computers!

###Algorithm

The approach described above could be easily implemented with a single loop.  

**Non-recursive** approach in Python 3 <span class="toggle-code">Show/Hide</span>:

    def binpow(a, b):
	    res = 1
	    cur = a
	    while b > 0:
		    if b & 1:
			    res *= cur
		    cur *= cur
		    b >>= 1
	    return res

Approach in C++ <span class="toggle-code">Show/Hide</span>:

	long long binpow(long long a,long long b)
	{
		long long res = 1;
		while(b){
			if(b&1) res = res*a;
			a = (a*a);
			b >>=1;
		}
		return res;
	}

This approach builds the result starting from smallest degrees of `a`. If we use recursion
instead of loop we can work in "inverse" direction, starting from largest degrees and dividing
`b` in two at each step.
  
**Recursive** approach in Python 3 <span class="toggle-code">Show/Hide</span>:

    def binpow(a, b):
	    if b == 1:
		    return a
	    res = binpow(a, b // 2)
	    return res * res * (a if b % 2 != 0 else 1)

Approach in c++<span class="toggle-code">Show/Hide</span>:

	long long binpow(long long a,long long b)
	{
		if(b==1) return a;
		long long res = binpow(a,b/2);
		if(b%2)return res*res*a;
		else return res*res;
	}

We can explain this last approach mathematically:  
$a^{b} = (a^{b/2})^2 \quad$ for even `b`,  
$a^{b} = (a^{(b-1)/2})^2 \cdot a \quad$ for odd `b`,  
$a^{1} = a$.
