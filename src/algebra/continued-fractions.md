# Continued fractions

**Continued fraction** is a representation of a real number as a specific convergent sequence of rational numbers. They are useful in competitive programming because they are easy to compute and can be efficiently used to find the best possible rational approximation of the underlying real number (among all numbers whose denominator doesn't exceed a given value).

Besides that, continued fractions are closely related to Euclidean algorithm which makes them useful in a bunch of number-theoretical problems.

## Continued fraction representation

!!! abstract "Definition"
    Let $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_k \in \mathbb Z$ and $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k \geq 1$. Then the expression

    $$r=a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{\dots + \frac{1}{a_k}}},$$

    is called the **continued fraction representation** of the rational number $r$ and is denoted shortly as $r=[a_0;a_1,a_2,\dots,a_k]$.

??? example
    Let $r = \frac{5}{3}$. There are two ways to represent it as a continued fraction:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    r = [1;1,1,1] &= 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1}}},\\
    r = [1;1,2] &= 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2}}.
    \end{align}
    $$

!!! note "Different representations and representation length for rational numbers"

    It can be proven that any rational number can be represented as a continued fraction in exactly $2$ ways:

    $$r = [a_0;a_1,\dots,a_k,1] = [a_0;a_1,\dots,a_k+1].$$

    Moreover, the length $k$ of such continued fraction is estimated as $k = O(\log \min(p, q))$ for $r=\frac{p}{q}$.

    The reasoning behind this will be clear once we delve into the details of the continued fraction construction.

!!! abstract "Definition"
    Let $a_0,a_1,a_2, \dots$ be an integer sequence such that $a_1, a_2, \dots \geq 1$. Let $r_k = [a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$. Then the expression

    $$r = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2+\dots}} = \lim\limits_{k \to \infty} r_k.$$

    is called the **continued fraction representation** of the irrational number $r$ and is denoted shortly as $r = [a_0;a_1,a_2,\dots]$.

!!! note "Basic arithmetics"
    Note that for $r=[a_0;a_1,\dots]$ and integer $k$, it holds that $r+k = [a_0+k; a_1, \dots]$.

    Another important observation that $\frac{1}{r}=[0;a_0, a_1, \dots]$ when $a_0 \neq 0$ and $\frac{1}{r} = [a_1; a_2, \dots]$ when $a_0 = 0$.

!!! abstract "Definition"
    In the definition above, rational numbers $r_0, r_1, r_2, \dots$ are called the **convergents** of $r$.

    Correspondingly, individual $r_k = [a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k] = \frac{p_k}{q_k}$ is called the $k$-th **convergent** of $r$.

??? example
    Consider $r = [1; 1, 1, 1, \dots]$. It can be proven by induction that $r_k = \frac{F_{k+2}}{F_{k+1}}$, where $F_k$ is the Fibonacci sequence defined as $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and $F_{k} = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$. From the Binet's formula, it is known that

    $$r_k = \frac{\phi^{k+2} - \psi^{k+2}}{\phi^{k+1} - \psi^{k+1}},$$

    where $\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$ is the golden ratio and $\psi = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2} = -\frac{1}{\phi} \approx -0.618$. Thus,

    $$r = 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\dots}}=\lim\limits_{k \to \infty} r_k = \phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$$

    Note that in this specific case, an alternative way to find $r$ would be to solve the equation

    $$r = 1+\frac{1}{r} \implies r^2 = r + 1. $$


!!! abstract "Definition"
    Let $r_k = [a_0; a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}, a_k]$. The numbers $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}, t]$ for $1 \leq t \leq a_k$ are called **semiconvergents**.

    We will typically refer to (semi)convergents that are greater than $r$ as **upper** (semi)convergents and to those that are less than $r$ as **lower** (semi)convergents.

!!! abstract "Definition"
    Complementary to convergents, we define the **residues** as $s_k = [a_k; a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, \dots]$. Correspondingly, we will call an individual $s_k$ the $k$-th residue of $r$.

!!! note "Connection between residues and continued fraction representation"

    From the definitions above, $s_k \geq 1$ for $k \geq 1$.

    Let's treat $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ as a formal algebraic expression and allow arbitrary real numbers instead of $a_i$, then, by definition,

    $$r = [a_0; a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}, s_k].$$

    In particular, $r = [s_0] = s_0$. On the other hand, we can express $s_k$ as

    $$s_k = [a_k; s_{k+1}] = a_k + \frac{1}{s_{k+1}},$$

    meaning that we can compute $a_k = \lfloor s_k \rfloor$ and $s_{k+1} = (s_k - a_k)^{-1}$ from $s_k$.

    The sequence $a_0, a_1, \dots$ is well-defined unless $s_k=a_k$ which only happens when $r$ is a rational number.

    Thus the continued fraction representation is uniquely defined for any irrational number $r$.

### Implementation

In the code snippets we will mostly assume finite continued fractions.

!!! note "Transition formulas"
    From $s_k$, the transition to $s_{k+1}$ looks like

    $$s_k =\left\lfloor s_k \right\rfloor + \frac{1}{s_{k+1}}.$$

    From this expression, the next residue $s_{k+1}$ is obtained as

    $$s_{k+1} = \left(s_k-\left\lfloor s_k\right\rfloor\right)^{-1}.$$

    For $s_k=\frac{p}{q}$ it means that

    $$
    s_{k+1} = \left(\frac{p}{q}-\left\lfloor \frac{p}{q} \right\rfloor\right)^{-1} = \frac{q}{p-q\cdot \lfloor \frac{p}{q} \rfloor} = \frac{q}{p \bmod q}.
    $$

    Thus, computation of a continued fraction representation for $r=\frac{p}{q}$ follows the same steps as the Euclidean algorithm for $p$ and $q$.

=== "C++"
    ```cpp
    auto fraction(int p, int q) {
        vector<int> a;
        while(q) {
            a.push_back(p / q);
            tie(p, q) = make_pair(q, p % q);
        }
        return a;
    }
    ```
=== "Python"
    ```py
    def fraction(p, q):
        a = []
        while q:
            a.append(p // q)
            p, q = q, p % q
        return a
    ```

## Key results

To provide some motivation for further study of continued fraction, we give some key facts now.

??? note "Recurrence"
    For the convergents $r_k = \frac{p_k}{q_k}$, the following recurrence stands, allowing their fast computation:
    
    $$\frac{p_k}{q_k}=\frac{a_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}}{a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}},$$
    
    where $\frac{p_{-1}}{q_{-1}}=\frac{1}{0}$ and $\frac{p_{-2}}{q_{-2}}=\frac{0}{1}$.

??? note "Deviations"
    The deviation of $r_k = \frac{p_k}{q_k}$ from $r$ can be generally estimated as
    
    $$\left|\frac{p_k}{q_k}-r\right| \leq \frac{1}{q_k q_{k+1}} \leq \frac{1}{q_k^2}.$$
    
    Multiplying both sides with $q_k$, we obtain alternate estimation:
    
    $$|p_k - q_k r| \leq \frac{1}{q_{k+1}}.$$

    From the recurrence above it follows that $q_k$ grows at least as fast as Fibonacci numbers.

    On the picture below you may see the visualization of how convergents $r_k$ approach $r=\frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}$:

    ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Golden_ration_convergents.svg)

    $r=\frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}$ is depicted by blue dotted line. Odd convergents approach it from above and even convergents approach it from below.

??? note "Lattice hulls"
    Consider convex hulls of points above and below the line $y=rx$.
    
    Odd convergents $(q_k;p_k)$ are the vertices of the upper hull, while the even convergents $(q_k;p_k)$ are the vertices of the bottom hull.
    
    All integers vertices on the hulls are obtained as $(q;p)$ such that
    
    $$\frac{p}{q} = \frac{tp_{k-1} + p_{k-2}}{tq_{k-1} + q_{k-2}}$$
    
    for integer $0 \leq t \leq a_k$. In other words, the set of lattice points on the hulls corresponds to the set of semiconvergents.

    On the picture below, you may see the convergents and semiconvergents (intermediate gray points) of $r=\frac{9}{7}$.

    ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Continued_convergents_geometry.svg)

??? note "Best approximations"
    Let $\frac{p}{q}$ be the fraction to minimize $\left|r-\frac{p}{q}\right|$ subject to $q \leq x$ for some $x$.
    
    Then $\frac{p}{q}$ is a semiconvergent of $r$.

The last fact allows to find the best rational approximations of $r$ by checking its semiconvergents.

Below you will find the further explanation and a bit of intuition and interpretation for these facts.

## Convergents

Let's take a closer look at the convergents that were defined earlier. For $r=[a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots]$, its convergents are

\begin{gather}
r_0=[a_0],\\r_1=[a_0, a_1],\\ \dots,\\ r_k=[a_0, a_1, \dots, a_k].
\end{gather}

Convergents are the core concept of continued fractions, so it is important to study their properties.

!!! note "Recurrence"
    For the number $r$, its $k$-th convergent $r_k = \frac{p_k}{q_k}$ can be computed as

    $$r_k = \frac{P_k(a_0,a_1,\dots,a_k)}{P_{k-1}(a_1,\dots,a_k)} = \frac{a_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}}{a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}},$$

    where $P_k(a_0,\dots,a_k)$ is [the continuant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuant_(mathematics)), a multivariate polynomial defined as

    $$P_k(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_k) = \det \begin{bmatrix}
    x_k & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
    -1 & x_{k-1} & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
    0 & -1 & x_2 & . & \vdots \\
    \vdots & \vdots & . & \ddots & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & \dots & -1 & x_0
    \end{bmatrix}_{\textstyle .}$$

    Thus, $r_k$ is a weighted [mediant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediant_(mathematics)) of $r_{k-1}$ and $r_{k-2}$.

    For consistency, two additional convergents $r_{-1} = \frac{1}{0}$ and $r_{-2} = \frac{0}{1}$ are defined.

    Note that if $\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(c,d)=1$ then $\gcd(a+c,b+d)=1$ as well, hence for all convergents $r_k = \frac{p_k}{q_k}$, it holds that $\gcd(p_k, q_k)=1$.

??? hint "Detailed explanation"

    The numerator and the denominator of $r_k$ can be seen as multivariate polynomials of $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_k$:

    $$r_k = \frac{P_k(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_k)}{Q_k(a_0,a_1, \dots, a_k)}.$$

    From the definition of convergents,

    $$r_k = a_0 + \frac{1}{[a_1;a_2,\dots, a_k]}= a_0 + \frac{Q_{k-1}(a_1, \dots, a_k)}{P_{k-1}(a_1, \dots, a_k)} = \frac{a_0 P_{k-1}(a_1, \dots, a_k) + Q_{k-1}(a_1, \dots, a_k)}{P_{k-1}(a_1, \dots, a_k)}.$$

    From this follows $Q_k(a_0, \dots, a_k) = P_{k-1}(a_1, \dots, a_k)$. This yields the relation

    $$P_k(a_0, \dots, a_k) = a_0 P_{k-1}(a_1, \dots, a_k) + P_{k-2}(a_2, \dots, a_k).$$

    Initially, $r_0 = \frac{a_0}{1}$ and $r_1 = \frac{a_0 a_1 + 1}{a_1}$, thus

    $$\begin{align}P_0(a_0)&=a_0,\\ P_1(a_0, a_1) &= a_0 a_1 + 1.\end{align}$$

    For consistency, it is convenient to define $P_{-1} = 1$ and $P_{-2}=0$ and formally say that $r_{-1} = \frac{1}{0}$ and $r_{-2}=\frac{0}{1}$.

    From numerical analysis, it is known that the determinant of an arbitrary tridiagonal matrix

    $$T_k = \det \begin{bmatrix}
    a_0 & b_0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
    c_0 & a_1 & b_1 & \dots & 0 \\
    0 & c_1 & a_2 & . & \vdots \\
    \vdots & \vdots & . & \ddots & c_{k-1} \\
    0 & 0 & \dots & b_{k-1} & a_k
    \end{bmatrix}$$

    can be computed recursively as $T_k = a_k T_{k-1} - b_{k-1} c_{k-1} T_{k-2}$. Comparing it to $P_k$, we get a direct expression

    $$P_k = \det \begin{bmatrix}
    x_k & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
    -1 & x_{k-1} & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
    0 & -1 & x_2 & . & \vdots \\
    \vdots & \vdots & . & \ddots & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & \dots & -1 & x_0
    \end{bmatrix}_{\textstyle .}$$

    This polynomial is also known as [the continuant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuant_(mathematics)) due to its close relation with continued fraction. The continuant won't change if the sequence on the main diagonal is reversed. This yields an alternative formula to compute it:

    $$P_k(a_0, \dots, a_k) = a_k P_{k-1}(a_0, \dots, a_{k-1}) + P_{k-2}(a_0, \dots, a_{k-2}).$$

### Implementation

We will compute the convergents as a pair of sequences $p_{-2}, p_{-1}, p_0, p_1, \dots, p_k$ and $q_{-2}, q_{-1}, q_0, q_1, \dots, q_k$:

=== "C++"
    ```cpp
    auto convergents(vector<int> a) {
        vector<int> p = {0, 1};
        vector<int> q = {1, 0};
        for(auto it: a) {
            p.push_back(p[p.size() - 1] * it + p[p.size() - 2]);
            q.push_back(q[q.size() - 1] * it + q[q.size() - 2]);
        }
        return make_pair(p, q);
    }
    ```
=== "Python"
    ```py
    def convergents(a):
        p = [0, 1]
        q = [1, 0]
        for it in a:
            p.append(p[-1]*it + p[-2])
            q.append(q[-1]*it + q[-2])
        return p, q
    ```

## Organizing continued fractions in trees

There are two major ways to unite all possible continued fractions into useful tree structures.

The Stern-Brocot tree is particularly useful because it allows to do a binary search on all rational numbers and the result would converge as fast as convergents of continued fractions do.

!!! note "Connection with the Stern–Brocot tree"
    [The Stern-Brocot tree](../others/stern_brocot_tree_farey_sequences.md) is a binary search tree that contains all distinct positive rational numbers.

    The tree generally looks as follows:

    <figure>![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/SternBrocotTree.svg)
    <figcaption>_[The image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SternBrocotTree.svg) by [Aaron Rotenberg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Aaron_Rotenberg) is licensed under [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en)_</figcaption></figure>

    Fractions $\frac{0}{1}$ and $\frac{1}{0}$ are "virtually" kept on the left and right sides of the tree correspondingly.

    Then the fraction in a node is a mediant $\frac{a+c}{b+d}$ of two fractions $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$ above it.

    From the $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=\frac{a_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}}{a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}}$ recurrence we see that the continued fraction representation encodes the path to the fraction $\frac{p_k}{q_k}$ in the Stern-Brocot tree.

    To find $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_{k}, 1]$ in a tree, one needs to move $a_0$ times to the right, $a_1$ times to the left, $a_2$ times to the right and so on, ignoring the last $1$.

    From this follows that the parent of $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k,1]$ is obtained by taking one step back in the last used direction.

    In other words, it is $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k-1,1]$ when $a_k > 1$ and $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}, 1]$ when $a_k = 1$.

    On the other hand, this also allows to derive that the children of $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k, 1]$ are $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k+1, 1]$ and $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k, 1, 1]$.

    There is an indexing of Stern-Brocot vertices that is consistent with this structure. Let's assign the root vertex an index $1$. Then for a vertex number $v$, index of its left child is obtained by changing leading bit of $v$ from $1$ to $10$ and for the right child, it's obtained by changing leading bit of $v$ from $1$ to $11$:

    <figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Stern-brocot-index.svg" width="500px"/></figure>

    In this indexing, the continued fraction representation of a rational number specifies the [run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) of its binary index.

    For example, for $\frac{5}{2} = [2;2] = [2;1,1]$, its index is $1011_2$ and run-length encoding of it, if bits are considered in ascending order, is exactly $[2;1,1]$.

    Another example is $\frac{2}{5} = [0;2,2]=[0;2,1,1]$, which has index $1100_2$ and its run-length encoding is, indeed, $[0;2,2]$.

Another, somewhat simpler way to organize continued fractions in a binary tree is the Calkin-Wilf tree. Unfortunately, unlike the Stern-Brocot tree, Calkin-Wilf tree is not a binary _search_ tree, so it can't be used to emulate rational binary search.

!!! note "Connection with the Calkin–Wilf tree"
    [The Calkin-Wilf tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calkin–Wilf_tree) is another binary tree which contains all distinct positive rational numbers.

    The tree generally looks like this:

    <figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Calkin–Wilf_tree.svg" width="500px"/>
    <figcaption>[The image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Calkin–Wilf_tree.svg) by [Olli Niemitalo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Olli_Niemitalo), [Proz](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Proz) is licensed under [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en)</figcaption></figure>

    In the root of the tree, the number $\frac{1}{1}$ is located. Then, for the vertex with a number $\frac{p}{q}$, its children are $\frac{p}{p+q}$ and $\frac{p+q}{q}$.

    In the Calkin-Wilf tree, for the fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, its direct parent is $\frac{p-q}{q}$ when $p>q$ and $\frac{p}{q-p}$ otherwise.

    For the Stern-Brocot tree, we used the recurrence for convergents. To draw the connection between the continued fraction and the Calkin-Wilf tree, we should recall the recurrence for residues. If $s_k = \frac{p}{q}$, then $s_{k+1} = \frac{q}{p \mod q} = \frac{q}{p-\lfloor p/q \rfloor \cdot q}$.

    On the other hand, if we repeatedly go from $s_k = \frac{p}{q}$ to its parent in the Calkin-Wilf tree when $p > q$, we will end up in $\frac{p \mod q}{q} = \frac{1}{s_{k+1}}$. If we continue doing so, we will end up in $s_{k+2}$, then $\frac{1}{s_{k+3}}$ and so on. From this we can deduce that:

    1. When $a_0> 0$, the direct parent of $[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ in the Calkin-Wilf tree is $\frac{p-q}{q}=[a_0 - 1; a_1, \dots, a_k]$.
    2. When $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1 > 1$, its direct parent is $\frac{p}{q-p} = [0; a_1 - 1, a_2, \dots, a_k]$.
    3. And when $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1 = 1$, its direct parent is $\frac{p}{q-p} = [a_2; a_3, \dots, a_k]$.

    Correspondingly, children of $\frac{p}{q} = [a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ are

    1. $\frac{p+q}{q}=1+\frac{p}{q}$, which is $[a_0+1; a_1, \dots, a_k]$,
    2. $\frac{p}{p+q} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{q}{p}}$, which is $[0, 1, a_0, a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $a_0 > 0$ and $[0, a_1+1, a_2, \dots, a_k]$ for $a_0=0$.

    Noteworthy, if we enumerate vertices of the Calkin-Wilf tree in the breadth-first search order (that is, the root has a number $1$, and the children of the vertex $v$ have indices $2v$ and $2v+1$ correspondingly), the index of the rational number in the Calkin-Wilf tree would be the same as in the Stern-Brocot tree.

    Thus, numbers on the same levels of the Stern-Brocot tree and the Calkin-Wilf tree are the same, but their ordering differs through the [bit-reversal permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit-reversal_permutation).
## Convergence

_You can mostly skip this section if you're more interested in practical results._

!!! note "Convergence rate"
    For the number $r$ and its $k$-th convergent $r_k=\frac{p_k}{q_k}$ the following formula stands:

    $$r_k = a_0 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{(-1)^{i-1}}{q_i q_{i-1}}.$$

    In particular,

    $$r_k - r_{k-1} = \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{q_k q_{k-1}}$$

    and

    $$\left| r-\frac{p_k}{q_k} \right| \leq \frac{1}{q_{k+1}q_k} \leq \frac{1}{q_k^2}.$$

    The latter inequality is due to the fact that $r_k$ and $r_{k+1}$ are generally located on different sides of $r$, thus

    $$|r-r_k| = |r_k-r_{k+1}|-|r-r_{k+1}| \leq |r_k - r_{k+1}|.$$

??? tip "Detailed explanation"

    To estimate $|r-r_k|$, we start by estimating the difference between adjacent convergents. By definition,

    $$\frac{p_k}{q_k} - \frac{p_{k-1}}{q_{k-1}} = \frac{p_k q_{k-1} - p_{k-1} q_k}{q_k q_{k-1}}.$$

    Replacing $p_k$ and $q_k$ in the numerator with their recurrences, we get

    $$\begin{align} p_k q_{k-1} - p_{k-1} q_k &= (a_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}) q_{k-1} - p_{k-1} (a_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2})
    \\&= p_{k-2} q_{k-1} - p_{k-1} q_{k-2},\end{align}$$

    thus the numerator of $r_k - r_{k-1}$ is always the negated numerator of $r_{k-1} - r_{k-2}$. It, in turn, equals to $1$ for

    $$r_1 - r_0=\left(a_0+\frac{1}{a_1}\right)-a_0=\frac{1}{a_1},$$

    thus

    $$r_k - r_{k-1} = \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{q_k q_{k-1}}.$$

    This yields an alternative representation of $r_k$ as a partial sum of infinite series:

    $$r_k = (r_k - r_{k-1}) + \dots + (r_1 - r_0) + r_0
    = a_0 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \frac{(-1)^{i-1}}{q_i q_{i-1}}.$$

    From the recurrent relation it follows that $q_k$ monotonously increases at least as fast as Fibonacci numbers, thus

    $$r = \lim\limits_{k \to \infty} r_k = a_0 + \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{i-1}}{q_i q_{i-1}}$$

    is always well-defined, as the underlying series always converge. Noteworthy, the residual series

    $$r-r_k = \sum\limits_{i=k+1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{i-1}}{q_i q_{i-1}}$$

    has the same sign as $(-1)^k$ due to how fast $q_i q_{i-1}$ decreases. Hence even-indexed $r_k$ approach $r$ from below while odd-indexed $r_k$ approach it from above:

    <figcaption>_Convergents of $r=\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}=[1;1,1,\dots]$ and their distance from $r$._</figcaption></figure>

    From this picture we can see that

    $$|r-r_k| = |r_k - r_{k+1}| - |r-r_{k+1}| \leq |r_k - r_{k+1}|,$$

    thus the distance between $r$ and $r_k$ is never larger than the distance between $r_k$ and $r_{k+1}$:

    $$\left|r-\frac{p_k}{q_k}\right| \leq \frac{1}{q_k q_{k+1}} \leq \frac{1}{q_k^2}.$$

## Geometric interpretation

!!! note "Numbers as vectors"
    Let $\vec r_k = (q_k;p_k)$ for the convergent $r_k = \frac{p_k}{q_k}$. Then, the following recurrence holds:

    $$\vec r_k = a_k \vec r_{k-1} + \vec r_{k-2}.$$

    We additionally define $\vec r = (1;r)$. In these terms, each vector $(x;y)$ corresponds to the number that is equal to its slope coefficient $\frac{y}{x}$.

!!! note "Formulas for $a_k$ and $s_k$ in terms of convergents"
    With the notion of [pseudoscalar product](../geometry/basic-geometry.md) $(x_1;y_1) \times (x_2;y_2) = x_1 y_2 - x_2 y_1$, it can be shown (see the explanation below) that

    $$s_k = -\frac{\vec r_{k-2} \times \vec r}{\vec r_{k-1} \times \vec r} = \left|\frac{\vec r_{k-2} \times \vec r}{\vec r_{k-1} \times \vec r}\right|.$$

    The last equation is due to the fact that $r_{k-1}$ and $r_{k-2}$ lie on the different sides of $r$, thus pseudoscalar products of $\vec r_{k-1}$ and $\vec r_{k-2}$ with $\vec r$ have distinct signs.

    With $a_k = \lfloor s_k \rfloor$ in mind, formula for $\vec r_k$ now looks like

    $$\vec r_k = \vec r_{k-2} + \left\lfloor \left| \frac{\vec r \times \vec r_{k-2}}{\vec r \times \vec r_{k-1}}\right|\right\rfloor \vec r_{k-1}.$$

    Note that $\vec r_k \times r = (q;p) \times (1;r) = qr - p$, thus

    $$a_k = \left\lfloor \left| \frac{q_{k-1}r-p_{k-1}}{q_{k-2}r-p_{k-2}} \right| \right\rfloor.$$

??? hint "Explanation"
    As we have already noted, $a_k = \lfloor s_k \rfloor$, where $s_k = [a_k; a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, \dots]$. On the other hand, from the convergent recurrence we derive that

    $$r = [a_0; a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}, s_k] = \frac{s_k p_{k-1} + p_{k-2}}{s_k q_{k-1} + q_{k-2}}.$$

    In vector form, it rewrites as

    $$\vec r \parallel s_k \vec r_{k-1} + \vec r_{k-2},$$

    meaning that $\vec r$ and $s_k \vec r_{k-1} + \vec r_{k-2}$ are collinear (that is, have the same slope coefficient). Taking the [pseudoscalar product](../geometry/basic-geometry.md) of both parts with $\vec r$, we get

    $$0 = s_k (\vec r_{k-1} \times \vec r) + (\vec r_{k-2} \times \vec r),$$

    which yields the final formula

    $$s_k = -\frac{\vec r_{k-2} \times \vec r}{\vec r_{k-1} \times \vec r}.$$

!!! example "Nose stretching algorithm"
    Each time you add $\vec r_{k-1}$ to the vector $\vec p$, the value of $\vec p \times \vec r$ is increased by $\vec r_{k-1} \times \vec r$.

    Thus, $a_k=\lfloor s_k \rfloor$ is the maximum integer number of $\vec r_{k-1}$ vectors that can be added to $\vec r_{k-2}$ without changing the sign of the cross product with $\vec r$.

    In other words, $a_k$ is the maximum integer number of times you can add $\vec r_{k-1}$ to $\vec r_{k-2}$ without crossing the line defined by $\vec r$:

    <figcaption>_Convergents of $r=\frac{7}{9}=[0;1,3,2]$. Semiconvergents correspond to intermediate points between gray arrows._</figcaption></figure>

    On the picture above, $\vec r_2 = (4;3)$ is obtained by repeatedly adding $\vec r_1 = (1;1)$ to $\vec r_0 = (1;0)$.

    When it is not possible to further add $\vec r_1$ to $\vec r_0$ without crossing the $y=rx$ line, we go to the other side and repeatedly add $\vec r_2$ to $\vec r_1$ to obtain $\vec r_3 = (9;7)$.

    This procedure generates exponentially longer vectors, that approach the line.

    For this property, the procedure of generating consequent convergent vectors was dubbed the **nose stretching algorithm** by Boris Delaunay.

!!! note "Klein polygons"

    If we look on the triangle drawn on points $\vec r_{k-2}$, $\vec r_{k}$ and $\vec 0$ we will notice that its doubled area is

    $$|\vec r_{k-2} \times \vec r_k| = |\vec r_{k-2} \times (\vec r_{k-2} + a_k \vec r_{k-1})| = a_k |\vec r_{k-2} \times \vec r_{k-1}| = a_k.$$

    Combined with the [Pick's theorem](../geometry/picks-theorem.md), it means that there are no lattice points strictly inside the triangle and the only lattice points on its border are $\vec 0$ and $\vec r_{k-2} + t \cdot \vec r_{k-1}$ for all integer $t$ such that $0 \leq t \leq a_k$. When joined for all possible $k$ it means that there are no integer points in the space between polygons formed by even-indexed and odd-indexed convergent vectors.

    This, in turn, means that $\vec r_k$ with odd coefficients form a convex hull of lattice points with $x \geq 0$ above the line $y=rx$, while $\vec r_k$ with even coefficients form a convex hull of lattice points with $x > 0$ below the line $y=rx$.


!!! abstract "Definition"

    These polygons are also known as **Klein polygons**, named after Felix Klein who first suggested this geometric interpretation to the continued fractions.

## Problem examples

Now that the most important facts and concepts were introduced, it is time to delve into specific problem examples.

!!! example "Convex hull under the line"
    Find the convex hull of lattice points $(x;y)$ such that $0 \leq x \leq N$ and $0 \leq y \leq rx$ for $r=[a_0;a_1,\dots,a_k]=\frac{p_k}{q_k}$.

??? hint "Solution"
    If we were considering the unbounded set $0 \leq x$, the upper convex hull would be given by the line $y=rx$ itself.

    However, with additional constraint $x \leq N$ we'd need to eventually deviate from the line to maintain proper convex hull.

    Let $t = \lfloor \frac{N}{q_k}\rfloor$, then first $t$ lattice points on the hull after $(0;0)$ are $\alpha \cdot (q_k; p_k)$ for integer $1 \leq \alpha \leq t$.

    However $(t+1)(q_k; p_k)$ can't be next lattice point since $(t+1)q_k$ is greater than $N$.

    To get to the next lattice points in the hull, we should get to the point $(x;y)$ which diverges from $y=rx$ by the smallest margin, while maintaining $x \leq N$.

    <figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Lattice-hull.svg" width="500px"/>
    <figcaption>Convex hull of lattice points under $y=\frac{4}{7}x$ for $0 \leq x \leq 19$ consists of points $(0;0), (7;4), (14;8), (16;9), (18;10), (19;10)$.</figcaption></figure>

    Let $(x; y)$ be the last current point in the convex hull. Then the next point $(x'; y')$ is such that $x' \leq N$ and $(x'; y') - (x; y) = (\Delta x; \Delta y)$ is as close to the line $y=rx$ as possible. In other words, $(\Delta x; \Delta y)$ maximizes $r \Delta x - \Delta y$ subject to $\Delta x \leq N - x$ and $\Delta y \leq r \Delta x$.

    Points like that lie on the convex hull of lattice points below $y=rx$. In other words, $(\Delta x; \Delta y)$ must be a lower semiconvergent of $r$.

    That being said, $(\Delta x; \Delta y)$ is of form $(q_{i-1}; p_{i-1}) + t \cdot (q_i; p_i)$ for some odd number $i$ and $0 \leq t < a_i$.

    To find such $i$, we can traverse all possible $i$ starting from the largest one and use $t = \lfloor \frac{N-x-q_{i-1}}{q_i} \rfloor$ for $i$ such that $N-x-q_{i-1} \geq 0$.

    With $(\Delta x; \Delta y) = (q_{i-1}; p_{i-1}) + t \cdot (q_i; p_i)$, the condition $\Delta y \leq r \Delta x$ would be preserved by semiconvergent properties.

    And $t < a_i$ would hold because we already exhausted semiconvergents obtained from $i+2$, hence $x + q_{i-1} + a_i q_i = x+q_{i+1}$ is greater than $N$.

    Now that we may add $(\Delta x; \Delta y)$, to $(x;y)$ for $k = \lfloor \frac{N-x}{\Delta x} \rfloor$ times before we exceed $N$, after which we would try the next semiconvergent.

!!! example "[Timus - Crime and Punishment](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1430)"
    You're given integer numbers $A$, $B$ and $N$. Find $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$ such that $Ax + By \leq N$ and $Ax + By$ is the maximum possible.

    _Equivalent formulation:_ Given $A$, $B$, $C$ and $N$, find $x$ such that $0 \leq x \leq N$ and $\lfloor \frac{Ax+B}{C} \rfloor$ is the maximum possible.

??? hint "Solution"
    In the actual problem it holds that $1 \leq A, B, N \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$, so the problem can be solved in $O(\sqrt N)$.

    However, there is $O(\log N)$ solution with continued fractions.

    It is evident that one needs to find the maximum value of $\lfloor \frac{N-Ax}{B} \rfloor$ for $0 \leq x \leq \lfloor \frac{N}{A}\rfloor$.

    For our convenience, we will invert the direction of $x$, so that now we need to find the maximum value of $\lfloor \frac{Ax + \left(N \;\bmod\; A \right)}{B} \rfloor$ for $0 \leq x \leq \lfloor \frac{N}{A} \rfloor$.

    To treat it more generically, we will write a function that finds the maximum value of $\lfloor \frac{Ax+B}{C} \rfloor$ on $0 \leq x \leq N$.

    Core solution idea in this problem essentially repeats the previous problem, but instead of using lower semiconvergents to diverge from line, you use upper semiconvergents to get closer to the line without crossing it and without violating $x \leq N$. Unfortunately, unlike the previous problem, you need to make sure that you don't cross the $y=\frac{Ax+B}{C}$ line while getting closer to it, so you should keep it in mind when calculating semiconvergent's coefficient $t$.

    This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

    It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

    We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

    Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

    That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

!!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
    There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

    _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

??? hint "Solution"
    Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

    There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

    In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

    So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

    This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

    For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

    Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

    In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

            p, q = convergents(a)
            for i in range(2, len(q)):
                if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):
                    t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]
                    return q[i-1] + t*q[i]

    You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

    Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.

    _Equivalent formulation:_ You're given $\frac{0}{1} \leq \frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1} \leq \frac{1}{0}$. Find the rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q; p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
??? hint "Solution"
    Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

    Among such equations we have three significant groups:

    1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
    2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
    3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$ and $A_i \leq 0, B_i > 0$ bound possible values of $x$ and $y$ from two sides.

    Among two groups in the third point we should only leave one pair $(A_i, B_i)$ corresponding to the smallest (largest) slope.

    Now the problem is as follows: given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    In terms of the Stern-Brocot tree it means that we need to find the LCA of $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$. Due to the connection between Stern-Brocot tree and continued fraction, this LCA would roughly correspond to the largest common prefix of continued fraction representations for $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    So, if $\frac{p_0}{q_0} = [a_0; a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}, a_k, \dots]$ and $\frac{p_1}{q_1} = [a_0; a_1, \dots, a_{k-1}, b_k, \dots]$, the LCA in most cases is $[a_0; a_1, \dots, \min(a_k, b_k)+1]$.

    The solution above is true for $r_0$ and $r_1$ being irrational numbers. However, for rational $r_0$ and $r_1$, one of them could be the LCA itself which would require us to casework it. To simplify the solution for rational $r_0$ and $r_1$, however, it is possible to use continued fraction representation of $r_0 + \varepsilon$ and $r_1 - \varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon \sim 0$.
