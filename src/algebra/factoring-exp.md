# Binary Exponentiation by Factoring

Consider a problem of computing $ax^y \pmod{2^d}$, given integers $a$, $x$, $y$ and $d \geq 3$, where $x$ is odd.

Due to the structure of the multiplicative group modulo $2^d$, any number $x$ such that $x \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ can be represented as

$$
x \equiv b^{L(x)} \pmod{2^d},
$$

where $b \equiv 5 \pmod 8$. Without loss of generality we assume that $x \equiv 1 \pmod 4$, as we can reduce $x \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ to $x \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ by substituting $x \mapsto -x$ and $a \mapsto (-1)^{y} a$. In this notion, $ax^y$ is represented as

$$
a x^y \equiv a b^{yL(x)} \pmod{2^d}.
$$

The core idea of the algorithm is to simplify the computation of $L(x)$ and $b^{y L(x)}$ using the fact that we're working modulo $2^d$. For reasons that will be apparent later on, we'll be working with $4L(x)$ rather than $L(x)$, but taken modulo $2^d$ instead of $2^{d-2}$.

In this article, we will cover the implementation for $32$-bit integers. Let

* `mbin_log_32(r, x)` be a function that computes $r+4L(x) \pmod{2^d}$;
* `mbin_exp_32(r, x)` be a function that computes $r b^{\frac{x}{4}} \pmod{2^d}$;
* `mbin_power_odd_32(a, x, y)` be a function that computes $ax^y \pmod{2^d}$.

Then `mbin_power_odd_32` is implemented as follows:

```cpp
uint32_t mbin_power_odd_32(uint32_t rem, uint32_t base, uint32_t exp) {
    if (base & 2) {
        /* divider is considered negative */
        base = -base;
        /* check if result should be negative */
        if (exp & 1) {
            rem = -rem;
        }
    }
    return (mbin_exp_32(rem, mbin_log_32(0, base) * exp));
}
```

## Computing $4L(x)$ from $x$

Let $x$ be an odd number such that $x \equiv 1 \pmod 4$. It can be represented as 

$$
x \equiv (2^{a_1}+1)\dots(2^{a_k}+1) \pmod{2^d},
$$

where $1 < a_1 < \dots < a_k < d$. Here $L(\cdot)$ is well-defined for each multiplier, as they're equal to $1$ modulo $4$. Hence,

$$
4L(x) \equiv 4L(2^{a_1}+1)+\dots+4L(2^{a_k}+1) \pmod{2^{d}}.
$$

So, if we precompute $t_k = 4L(2^k+1)$ for all $1 < k < d$, we will be able to compute $4L(x)$ for any number $x$.

For 32-bit integers, we can use the following table:

```cpp
const uint32_t mbin_log_32_table[32] = {
    0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0xd3cfd984, 0x9ee62e18,
    0xe83d9070, 0xb59e81e0, 0xa17407c0, 0xce601f80,
    0xf4807f00, 0xe701fe00, 0xbe07fc00, 0xfc1ff800,
    0xf87ff000, 0xf1ffe000, 0xe7ffc000, 0xdfff8000,
    0xffff0000, 0xfffe0000, 0xfffc0000, 0xfff80000,
    0xfff00000, 0xffe00000, 0xffc00000, 0xff800000,
    0xff000000, 0xfe000000, 0xfc000000, 0xf8000000,
    0xf0000000, 0xe0000000, 0xc0000000, 0x80000000,
};
```

On practice, a slightly different approach is used than described above. Rather than finding the factorization for $x$, we will consequently multiply $x$ with $2^k+1$ until we turn it into $1$ modulo $2^d$. In this way, we will find the representation of $x^{-1}$, that is

$$
x (2^{a_1}+1)\dots(2^{a_k}+1) \equiv 1 \pmod {2^d}.
$$

To do this, we iterate over $n$ such that $1 < n < d$. If the current $x$ has $n$-th bit set, we multiply $x$ with $2^n+1$, which is conveniently done in C++ as `x = x + (x << n)`. This won't change bits lower than $n$, but will turn the $n$-th bit to zero, because $x$ is odd.

With all this in mind, the function `mbin_log_32(r, x)` is implemented as follows:

```cpp
uint32_t mbin_log_32(uint32_t r, uint32_t x) {
    uint8_t n;

    for (n = 2; n < 32; n++) {
        if (x & (1 << n)) {
            x = x + (x << n);
            r -= mbin_log_32_table[n];
        }
    }

    return r;
}
```

Note that $4L(x) = -4L(x^{-1})$, so instead of adding $4L(2^k+1)$, we subtract it from $r$, which initially equates to $0$.

## Computing $x$ from $4L(x)$

Note that for $k \geq 1$ it holds that

$$
(a 2^{k}+1)^2 = a^2 2^{2k} +a 2^{k+1}+1 = b2^{k+1}+1,
$$

from which (by repeated squaring) we can deduce that

$$
(2^a+1)^{2^b} \equiv 1 \pmod{2^{a+b}}.
$$

Applying this result to $a=2^k+1$ and $b=d-k$ we deduce that the multiplicative order of $2^k+1$ is a divisor of $2^{d-k}$.

This, in turn, means that $L(2^k+1)$ must be divisible by $2^{k}$, as the order of $b$ is $2^{d-2}$ and the order of $b^y$ is $2^{d-2-v}$, where $2^v$ is the highest power of $2$ that divides $y$, so we need

$$
2^{d-k} \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{d-2-v}},
$$

thus $v$ must be greater or equal to $k-2$. This is a bit ugly and to mitigate this we said in the beginning that we multiply $L(x)$ by $4$. Now if we know $4L(x)$, we can uniquely decomposing it into a sum of $4L(2^k+1)$ by consequentially checking bits in $4L(x)$. If the $n$-th bit is set to $1$, we will multiply the result with $2^k+1$ and reduce the current $4L(x)$ by $4L(2^k+1)$. Thus, `mbin_exp_32` is implemented as follows:

```cpp
uint32_t mbin_exp_32(uint32_t r, uint32_t x) {
    uint8_t n;

    for (n = 2; n < 32; n++) {
        if (x & (1 << n)) {
            r = r + (r << n);
            x -= mbin_log_32_table[n];
        }
    }

    return r;
}
```

## Further optimizations

It is possible to halve the number of iterations if you note that $4L(2^{d-1}+1)=2^{d-1}$ and that for $2k \geq d$ it holds that

$$
(2^k+1)^2 \equiv 2^{2k} + 2^{k+1}+1 \equiv 2^{k+1}+1 \pmod{2^d},
$$

which allows to deduce that $4L(2^k+1)=2^k$ for $2k \geq d$. So, you could simplify the algorithm by only going up to $\frac{d}{2}$ and then use the fact above to compute the remaining part with bitwise operations:

```cpp
uint32_t mbin_log_32(uint32_t r, uint32_t x) {
    uint8_t n;

    for (n = 2; n != 16; n++) {
        if (x & (1 << n)) {
            x = x + (x << n);
            r -= mbin_log_32_table[n];
        }
    }

    r -= (x & 0xFFFF0000);

    return r;
}

uint32_t mbin_exp_32(uint32_t r, uint32_t x) {
    uint8_t n;

    for (n = 2; n != 16; n++) {
        if (x & (1 << n)) {
            r = r + (r << n);
            x -= mbin_log_32_table[n];
        }
    }

    r *= 1 - (x & 0xFFFF0000);

    return r;
}
```
