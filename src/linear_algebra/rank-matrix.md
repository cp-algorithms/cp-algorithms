# Finding the rank of a matrix

**The rank of a matrix** is the largest number of linearly independent rows/columns of the matrix. The rank is not only defined  for square matrices.

The rank of a matrix can also be defined as the largest order of any non-zero minor in the matrix.

Let the matrix be rectangular and have size $N \times M$.
Note that if the matrix is square and its determinant is non-zero, then the rank is $N$ ($=M$); otherwise it will be less. Generally, the rank of a matrix does not exceed $\min (N, M)$.

## Algorithm

You can search for the rank using [Gaussian elimination](./linear_algebra/linear-system-gauss.html). We will perform the same operations as when solving the system or finding its determinant. But if at any step in the $i$-th column there are no rows with an non-empty entry among those that we didn't selected already, then we skip this step.
Otherwise, if we have found a row with a non-zero element in the $i$-th column during the $i$-th step, then we mark this row as a selected one, increase the rank by one (initially the rank is set equal to $0$), and perform the usual operations of taking this row away from the rest.

## Complexity

This algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.

## Implementation

```cpp matrix-rank
const double EPS = 1E-9;

int compute_rank(vector<vector<double>> A) {
    int n = A.size();
    int m = A[0].size();

    int rank = 0;
    vector<bool> row_selected(n, false);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int j;
        for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (!row_selected[j] && abs(A[j][i]) > EPS)
                break;
        }

        if (j != n) {
            ++rank;
            row_selected[j] = true;
            for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)
                A[j][p] /= A[j][i];
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                if (k != j && abs(A[k][i]) > EPS) {
                    for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)
                        A[k][p] -= A[j][p] * A[k][i];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return rank;
}
```
