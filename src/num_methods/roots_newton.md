# Newton's method for finding roots 

This is an iterative method invented by Isaac Newton around 1664. However, sometimes this method is called the Raphson method, since Raphson invented the same algorithm a few years after Newton, but his article was published much earlier.

The task is as follows. Given the following equation:

$$f(x) = 0$$

We want to solve the equation, more precisely, to find one of its roots (it is assumed that the root exists). It is assumed that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable on an interval $[a; b]$.
